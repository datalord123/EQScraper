http://www.eqsportsmassage.com,Afton,equine sports massage,"Equine massage is an extremely effective way to improve a horse's performance. Most athletic training programs emphasize building strength, speed and endurance. However, as training progresses, a horse loses flexibility and tends to develop muscle tension. Tighter muscles shorten his stride, restricting the natural flowing gaits, often causing resistance to training. Poor performance is a natural result of discomfort. It is unrealistic to expect performance from a horse that is in pain. Unfortunately, in the horse industry today, pain management is common practice and thoughtful, caring horsemanship is a dying art. Equine therapeutic massage increases performance level and endurance and assists in the prevention of debilitating muscular injuries, and in speeding injury recovery time among equine athletes. Additionally, equine sports and therapeutic massage are empirically proven to effect change in problem behaviors related to hidden pain and stiffness. As a professional massage practitioner with a thorough understanding of equine anatomy and biomechanics, I employ the proven physical therapy of massage in combination with Linda Tellington-Jones' TTouch, Young Living Essential Oils, and the knowledge I have gained through many years' study of natural horsemanship. I specialize in equine massage and bodywork for horses of all disciplines using these specially targeted modalities for treating common problems associated with riding and training. This synthesis of touch modalities provides a rich and varied inventory of tools for treating behavioral issues, musculoskeletal problems, and retraining horses' muscle memory for more efficient and pain-free action. Anything less than maximum musculoskeletal efficiency can lead to problems in performance or even injury. Athletes perform better when they move better.Any muscle that isn't working for your horse is working against him. The greatest gift you can give your horse is ease and freedom of motion.

http://www.uncommontouch.info,Amissville,UnCommon Touch,"The work I do with animals and humans is very similar.  I work intuitively, sometimes with a focus on a particular issueinjury, illness, emotions.  Other times, I just get out of the way and let the energy work its magic.  There is no modality or methodology.  I just bring a Gift that effects mind, body and spirit in miraculous ways. A key difference when working with animals is communication.  Humans, generally speaking, have a pretty good grasp of whats going on with them and can share verbally. With horses and other four-legged friends, things are a little different.  Human companions can share with me a veterinarians diagnosis or describe symptoms. Sometimes they are right but, again, generally speaking, thats not the entire picture.  So, when working with animals I listen.  Im not an animal communicator in the sense that most people presume one to be.  I just listen with all of my senses and allow an animals response to me and the energy guide how I move and breathe.  There are those who attempt to explain how the energy works.  The truth is, no one knows.  In my case, the only thing I know is that it does work. It works on dramatically shortening recovery time after acute injury; elimination of chronic injury and illness; emotional & physical trauma; behavioral issues for which no one else has found solutions.  I cant explain it and dont go looking for the how or why.  I just watch lame and wild horses transform into healthy, happy, active creatures.  I see paralyzed pooches wag, walk and otherwise be hale and hearty.The fee for animal work (including distance healing) is $85 for one hour.For testimonials, please go to: http://www.uncommontouch.info/UnCommonTouch.com/Animal_Work.html",20106,540-316-8034,VA,742 South Poes Road,Ingrid Oliphant,Alternative Therapies,ingrdo@gmail.com

,New Kent/ Lanexa/ Williamsburg,~N~ TOUCH Equine and Canine Massage Therapy,"~N~Touch massage therapy is dedicated to helping our best friends, our horses and our dogs! If you have ever had a massage then you know how great it feelsDescriptionIn all my years on this earth, I never dreamed I would be where I' am right now. I have a huge love of animals and I have always hated to see them suffer. Whether it was an injury or suffering at the hands of man.  I have trained horses the better part of 30 yrs. I always knew there was something more to offer our training horses but could never put my finger on it. Then one day I was rubbing down a horse and he felt knotted up in his back and hind quarters. I then started to rub him down with a form of massage.  He improved and was very happy after training and waited patiently for a rub down after his work.  So at that point I have used this on just about all the horses that I have handled.  Did I know what I was really doing...NO. But it made the horses happy and easier to handle. Just this past April 2014 I made my dreams come true and enrolled in the Equissage massage therapy certification course for Equine and /Canine therapy. This is where I met an awesome woman by the name of Mary Schreiber. My mentor and instructor. My life has changed since that first day in Mary's classroom in the basement of her farm house in Roundhill Va. We are friends and I still enjoy out little conversations when time permits! I want to thank her for all the confidence she gave me through my time spent there! I will always keep her dear to my heart! Now as Mary said"" I have a dream to massage every horse in the world just once....so that each might be favored with the release from pain that any good massage is capable of bringing to the body"" So we will massage on!!!! The Benefits of massage.Equine sports massage therapy is a non-invasive therapy that aids in the total health of your horse. Your horses body weight is 60% muscle thus tension and tightening in any part of your horses body reduces the effectiveness of the whole body. The benefits of an equine sports massage are many. Circulation is improved, thus promoting more rapid healing of injuries. Muscle tone is enhanced and range of motion is increased. Muscle spasms are eased and tension is relieved. Stimulates circulation in the lymphatic system thus hastening the elimination of waste products and other toxins. Connective tissue is lengthened thus preventing the formation of adhesions. Disposition can also improve.  Compression is the stroke that separates sports massage from other types of massage. When muscle is compressed against the bone, the muscle fibers spread apart. This action frees the restrictions and adhesions in the muscle and allows the blood supply to flow easily into the muscle. The increased blood flow carries oxygen and nutrients to the muscle and aids in removing metabolic waste. Compression is used to break up adhesions in the bellies of the muscle.  An equine sports massage is non-discriminatory. All equine breeds and all disciplines will benefit. Maintains the entire body in better physical conditionAids in preventing injuries and loss of mobilityBoosts athletic performance and enduranceRestores mobility to injured muscle tissueExtends the good health and overall life of the horses athletic career If your horse is also currently having Chiropractic work done, follow up with Sports massage, even if you fix a skeletal issue, you still have to retrain and work the muscles so the horse can benefit fully from the Chiropractic work performed.

http://www.firemansrunfarm.com,Lanexa,FIREMAN'S RUN FARM,"Training at Fireman's Run Farm Here at Firemans Run Farm, we have a very different approach to our clients training needs. We like to work in conjunction with your primary trainer (if you have one) to insure that we start your young horse as close as possible to your own trainers, and your needs, wants, and desires for your horse, also if your horses personality, and athleticism allows for the specified training. We realizes that your trainers may not have the time to do all the ground work necessary to get your young horse prepared to ride, and we understand that training is their lively hood and may not want to take the chance of getting them or you hurt. This is why we offer this type of approach to training. We are not here to compete with other trainers, but to work along side them for the best interest of their clients and horses. There fore our services take the hardest and the most time consuming part out of preparedness training for the both of you. Even if you have a horse that has any sort of bad vices such as, tying, bathing, clipping, saddling, bridling or loading we also offer retraining services for these types of problem horses. We take the time to desensitize our training horses to make training and riding easier and more enjoyable for you. That is why we recommend starting the training process from foal to 3 years old. These are the most impressionable ages for working with horses to prevent bad habits and vices from starting. They learn to trust and want to work for you, when the time is slowly taken to partner up with the horse. We offer reasonable board combined with training packages, for each individual client and horses needs. Please feel free to contact us for more information. We are located in Lanexa (New Kent) Virginia, which is 25 minutes from Williamsburg, and 45 minutes from Richmond. Our farm is nestled on a quiet stretch of road just a stones  throw from the Beautiful Chickahominy River. We offer services for the young horse, from foal to 3 years old. We specialize in imprinting our foals and yours, In-hand training for show, ground manners, starting young horses under saddle, and round pen training, also quality, reasonable board for foaling mares. We have two 14 x 12 video monitored foaling stalls, and four 12x12 mated stalls. With 12 acres in beautiful board fenced pastures. 60 foot round pen for starting and teaching young horses under saddle and lounging. Our 80 x 100 schooling ring is just the right size so the horses we start have room to move out but little room to run away with us. Since we are a small training facility we are able to tailor training to the individual needs of the horse and owner. Each horse is very different and we train according to their personalities. What may work for some, may not work for others? We never rush training at Firemans Run. We believe that each horse learns at their own pace, such as children. Training the young horse to be your partner is the foundation for future training with them. We also, strongly believe in making training fun!, We want the young horses to want to please, and be willing to work, there fore we produce a strong work ethic in our young training horses. Our motto is ""Be your horses' partner, not his adversary"". Teaching the young horse to respect you on the ground lays the foundation for them to respect you on their back.Tracey Leftwich",23089,757) 876-7705,VA,1360 Riverside Drive,Tracey Leftwich,Annual Events,tracey@firemansrunfarm.com

When I discuss a portrait with clients, I like to learn everything I can about their pet.. such as their likes and dislikes, how you spend your time together, and of course, why they are so special to you.  A portrait isn't just about capturing the light that catches their eye.. it's about the soul within. Photography: With years of experience in Boston shooting for hunts, horse shows, and other events, I now bring my years of expertise to Virginia, where I am now available full weekend days to shoot horse shows, as well as farm visits and portrait work. Marketing: I am also available to help market your sales horse. I can come to your farm or a horse show you will be attending, and take conformation and riding photos, as well as professional video of your rounds. Together we'll choose the best photographic images, video will be edited and assembled, and everything uploaded to the best sites possible to sell your horse. Leave all the annoying work to me, and I will send buyers your way. Please see my website for further details about my work.  I can prepare paintings usually within 2-4 weeks, and offer gift certificates. Reasonable rates. I am happy to travel and always enjoy meeting my clients. I look forward to speaking with you!

My small company provides photo services for almost any photographic needs in the Hampton Roads area and beyond. I specialize mostly in events like weddings, engagements, family reunions and birthday parties. For all the events I am using the term ""photojournalism"" to define a genre that recognizes coverage in real time by me being respectful of the natural occurrences without assuming a leadership position in arranging, staging, and prompting subjects.       As well as event photography I am specializing in both classic and contemporary fine portraits of individuals, couples, children, babies, families, and high school seniors. I do headshots and also comp cards (zed cards) for models. As an accomplished portraitist, I am seeing my responsibility as turning an individual into a work of art. Each portrait is created individually, based on the personality, character and style of the person in front of my camera. In addition I provide photo services included freelance photography services, image restoration, photo manipulation, photo collages, custom DVD presentations with music, coffee table books etc. Whatever your style is I am a photographer that is dedicated to meeting your needs and providing you with pictures you will always treasure.

http://www.affordablemanureremoval.com,Nokesville,Affordable Manure Removal,"We offer a variety of services for horse owners including reliable, affordable manure removal, spreading manure on your fields, bedding delivery (ask us about permanent bedding!), bush hogging, stone delivery, and other farm related services.  We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us! We've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it!) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help!BEDDINGWe provide 2 different types of bedding.  SAWDUSTFirst, we have sifted, white pine sawdust.  We have this product trucked in so even when local mills are not producing, we have sawdust available.  We can bring you a 16 cubic-yard bulk load (or an 8 cubic-foot half load) if you have a place to store bulk sawdust.  If you are not in the Northern Virginia area, we can arrange delivery of a semi tractor/trailer load (110 cubic-yards) to your facility.  Call us for a price!SHAVINGSSecond, we sell SUNCOAST Bedding.  This bedding is not a sawmill by-product (waste product of the lumber industry).  It is produced exclusively as animal bedding with appropriate quality control and standards guaranteed.  Each bag is ultra compressed for more bedding in each bale - the Large Flake bales provide ~10 Cubic Feet of expanded bedding and the Mini-Flake and Quarter Flake each expand to ~8 Cubic Feet. The bedding is screened multiple times to lower the amount of dust which also provides reliable quality of shavings. Since we use the products we sell, we can confidently say that this bedding is very consistent shipment after shipment. Also, their newest product, the Quarter Flake is a small flake (similar to what we used to sell) that sifts through your manure fork very easily. We also like the fact that SUNCOAST Bedding is a ""green company"". Of course, their product is natural and reclaimable. Additionally, any waste created in the manufacturing process is used to fuel their dryer burners...so nothing of the tree is wasted.MANURE REMOVALFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    If you have 5-9 horses at your place, we also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with a clean and empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are also photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. If you have a larger facility we can also arrange for a larger bin.  This will reduce the number of ""bin-swaps"" per month and help keep your costs down.MANURE SPREADERWe also have a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.  This revolutionary manure spreader breaks the manure into tiny pieces as you spread, offering an even, easily absorbed distribution of organic fertilizer to your fields.  You can see the 5 foot wide path of evenly spread manure behind the spreader.

Our horse boarding services are stall-based (no field board) and include daily horse turnout, stall cleaning, generous hay and feed, and fresh water. Only high quality hay, feed, and poplar sawdust bedding is used, and these materials are kept bone-dry in indoor storage. Horse diets, medications, turn-in/out, blanketing, etc. precisely follow owner/Vet instructions, and each horse is inspected daily for any physical changes or impending problems. While its a rare thing, owners and/or Vets are called immediately if anything untoward is detected (e.g., lost shoe, hoof soreness, nasal drainage, loss of appetite, etc.)Riding Instruction. Kathy manages and is primary instructor for the riding lessons (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) that we provide. Lessons are one hour in duration, and are either private (one student) or semi-private (two students.) This individual attention enables the serious rider to progress much more rapidly than she/he could in larger classes. Lessons are founded upon patience and trust, and the student can clearly hear and comprehend the lessons verbal instruction and explanation (which is given as he/she rides) because of state-of-art wireless headsets that instructor and student use. Our riding instruction services are performed at Mosby Farms only  not off site.Horse Training. Training programs for horses (primarily those boarded at our farm) can be arranged. We will work with owners to design training programs for their horses that are cost-effective and progressive. Exercising of horses is also available at reduced rates.Horse Sales. We continually seek and purchase quality horses, and fit them affordably and well to buying riders' capabilities. If you are considering buying a horse; youll find our experience helpful in defining the horse qualities that meet your specific requirements, as a basis for your search, be it at our farm or elsewhere.

Lessons focus on riding with a light hand and seat.  Lunge lessons are encouraged to help the rider become balanced both mentally and physically.

Windswept Farm is a co-op, which means that we share the daily care of our horses, as well as other chores such as stacking hay and mending fences. We don't offer field board, but because we're a co-op, monthly board is considerably less expensive than other barns in the area. Board is $350 per month, which covers hay, utilities and bedding. Members provide their own grain. We also offer a short-term boarding option for $400.00 a month. Sort-term board includes all of the same care as long-term.Each horse has an assigned stall with rubber mats and they are turned out in small groups. The barn also has three grooming areas with cross ties, a wash stall, a heated tackroom with a washer and dryer, a huge, level ring with lights, and access to some trails.While the property is currently for sale, we hope to stay at the farm until it sells. Although we do not have a specific date for when that will be, we have been informed by the current property owner that it will not be sold for quite some time.

http://www.firemansrunfarm.com,Lanexa,FIREMAN'S RUN FARM,"Training at Fireman's Run Farm Here at Firemans Run Farm, we have a very different approach to our clients training needs. We like to work in conjunction with your primary trainer (if you have one) to insure that we start your young horse as close as possible to your own trainers, and your needs, wants, and desires for your horse, also if your horses personality, and athleticism allows for the specified training. We realizes that your trainers may not have the time to do all the ground work necessary to get your young horse prepared to ride, and we understand that training is their lively hood and may not want to take the chance of getting them or you hurt. This is why we offer this type of approach to training. We are not here to compete with other trainers, but to work along side them for the best interest of their clients and horses. There fore our services take the hardest and the most time consuming part out of preparedness training for the both of you. Even if you have a horse that has any sort of bad vices such as, tying, bathing, clipping, saddling, bridling or loading we also offer retraining services for these types of problem horses. We take the time to desensitize our training horses to make training and riding easier and more enjoyable for you. That is why we recommend starting the training process from foal to 3 years old. These are the most impressionable ages for working with horses to prevent bad habits and vices from starting. They learn to trust and want to work for you, when the time is slowly taken to partner up with the horse. We offer reasonable board combined with training packages, for each individual client and horses needs. Please feel free to contact us for more information. We are located in Lanexa (New Kent) Virginia, which is 25 minutes from Williamsburg, and 45 minutes from Richmond. Our farm is nestled on a quiet stretch of road just a stones  throw from the Beautiful Chickahominy River. We offer services for the young horse, from foal to 3 years old. We specialize in imprinting our foals and yours, In-hand training for show, ground manners, starting young horses under saddle, and round pen training, also quality, reasonable board for foaling mares. We have two 14 x 12 video monitored foaling stalls, and four 12x12 mated stalls. With 12 acres in beautiful board fenced pastures. 60 foot round pen for starting and teaching young horses under saddle and lounging. Our 80 x 100 schooling ring is just the right size so the horses we start have room to move out but little room to run away with us. Since we are a small training facility we are able to tailor training to the individual needs of the horse and owner. Each horse is very different and we train according to their personalities. What may work for some, may not work for others? We never rush training at Firemans Run. We believe that each horse learns at their own pace, such as children. Training the young horse to be your partner is the foundation for future training with them. We also, strongly believe in making training fun!, We want the young horses to want to please, and be willing to work, there fore we produce a strong work ethic in our young training horses. Our motto is ""Be your horses' partner, not his adversary"". Teaching the young horse to respect you on the ground lays the foundation for them to respect you on their back.Tracey Leftwich",23089,757) 876-7705,VA,1360 Riverside Drive,Tracey Leftwich,Boarding,tracey@firemansrunfarm.com

http://www.milesofsmilestraining.com,Lovettsville,Miles of Smiles Training,"Leslie strongly believes that the foundation to a solid relationship with any horse is built upon clear communication, mutual respect and trust.  Her goal is to provide the horses she works with a solid foundation that will stay with them, independent of discipline specific training.  Putting training on a horse serves no purpose if the owner has no idea what's been done.  Before a horse comes to Leslie, the owner has to agree to come out and work with the horse for a couple of days at the end of the training so that they know how the horse has been worked.  By doing this, the owner learns the exercises the horse has learned.  They also learn tools to help them correct problems that may surface and they will have the skills to continue the training with the horse.  There are three basic rules that she follows:  she can't get hurt, the horse can't get hurt and the horse must be calmer at the end of the lesson.Leslie offers the following training services:One time training sessionsStarting an unbroke (allow 2 days)Trailer LoadingMonthly Training (4 weeks)Two-Week Tune UpGround Manners (2 weeks)LessonsWebsite:  www.milesofsmilestraining.com",20180,540 882 3697,VA,40563 Featherbed Lane,Leslie Gottesman,Boarding,Leslie@milesofsmilestraining.com

http://www.noahsstation.com/,Woodlawn,Noah's Station Equine Rescue,"Hope for abused and neglected horses Every day in America, thousands of animals are abused or neglected. These acts of cruelty range from days with no contact or affection to severe beatings and starvation. Some forms of abuse are intentional, while neglect often stems from owners who, despite their love for their pets, may be physically or financially unable to care for the animals they own. Regardless of the reasons for abuse or neglect, the animals still suffer physically, mentally, and emotionally. Abused animals become very withdrawn, fearful of the world around them. Noah's Station is an equine rescue located in the beautiful mountains of southwest Virginia. Abused and neglected horses receive the care and attention they need in order to enjoy life. After rehabilitation and training, these horses are adopted out to qualified families. At Noah's Station, we understand the damage abuse and neglect causes to all levels of an animal's being. Our staff combines time and patience with compassion and understanding to help abused animals heal. Medical, physical and mental areas are addressed in order to rebuild confidence and trust as well as good health.",24381,276-728-2096,VA,,Suzie Thompkins,Boarding,noahstn@swva.net

Kathy manages and is primary instructor for the riding lessons (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) that we provide. Lessons are one hour in duration, and are either private (one student) or semi-private (two students.)

http://www.brooksidewelsh.com,Brightwood,Brookside Stud,"Brookside Stud was founded and registered in 1979 with the original intent to breed and produce top quality useful Welsh Mountain ponies (Section A's) for the North American market without losing type. On May 12th 2001 Sandy Costanzo, married Gene O'Brien of the well known Virginia based Lakeview Stud, combining both studs and their ponies in harmony. Both Studs continue to keep their prefixes, and to maintain the same high standards previously expected in their individual breeding programs.Sandy Costanzo-O'Brien, founder, owner and manager of the stud, was raised in and around the Isle of Anglesey, North Wales and Liverpool, England. She had the good fortune to have first hand experience of the breeding of useful up-to-height Welsh Mountain ponies which her uncle bred along with an enormous herd of prize Welsh Black cattle. He was in fact also a respected judge in both categories in those days. She obtained for herself, in the process, invaluable lifelong opportunities and experiences. Making the process of learning easier with reference to Welsh ponies, and the comparisons and opinions on the different types within the breed standards more comprehensible.

http://www.americanridingpony.com,Jeffersonton,GaLa Farm,"GaLa Farm has been breeding and showing conformation hunter's for over 30 years. In 2001 as an aging ""baby boomer"" I decided to switch my focus to breeding top hunter show ponies. Though the TB/Welsh cross has been the gold standard for producing these top show ponies, I decided to change the recipe just a bit (by using the Caspian pony) with the goal of producing a more horse type crossbred pony. The American Riding Pony will be of superior quality following the same breeding strategy utilized by the top breeders in Britain, Germany, Australia and New Zealand to produce their very successful riding ponies. I believe the time has come that we should be producing the same type of ""Riding Pony"" found around the world, instead of importing them. The basic breeds I will use to develop the American Riding Pony are Thoroughbred, Trakehner, Welsh and Arab mares as well as crossbreds of each. The main difference in my breeding program is that these mares will be bred to a Caspian stallion to achieve the pony size. With the traditional welsh cross everyone holds their breath hoping the resulting foal will not go over 14.2. By using the Caspian stallions I am working with a genetic suit case that has thousands of years of very very small genetics - the majority of purebred Caspians are only 11 to 11.2 hands. There are no 12 to 13 hand parents or grand parents to add size to the pony foals suitcase. This also allows me the freedom to use quality mares up to 16.2 (instead of the 15.2 usually used when crossing with a welsh). Caspians are a rare breed, which in actuality, are genetically a horse - just in pony size. They have horse proportions and move with a longer, lighter, more horse like stride. The Caspian is a phenomenal jumper and has a wonderful trainable temperament.Eye appeal and performance ability are just two of the wonderful attributes I am looking for out of this new breeding program. Selectively breeding for excellent conformation and performance will be the basis of my foundation. The resulting cross-bred pony will also have horse proportions, with floating horse movement, good bone and substance and solid trainable temperament making the American Riding Pony equal to the best in the world. GaLa Farm realizes this program is very different from the traditional one, but I am very excited to start this new venture and am very committed to my goal. I intend to use my 30 years of breeding experience to breed the best today, to produce the pony champions of tomorrow.",22724,540-937-4204,VA,4567 Jeffersonton Rd.,Gail Forrest,Breeding & Sales-Horses & Ponies,gala_ponies@yahoo.com

When the Caspian is used on these type of mares, the resulting foal will not only be a quality show pony, but will be more like the very successful Riding Pony type found in Europe and Austrailia.

http://aurigafarm.8m.com/,Middleburg,Auriga Farm,"""Auriga"" (Awe-rye-gah) is a winter constellation in the northern hemisphere, and can be seen as a perfect pentagram of 5 stars directly overhead from the winter solstice to about mid-January .The name comes originally from the Greek constellation which was depicted as that of a Goatherd and his three kids. The alpha star was named ""Capella"", meaning to leap or frolic -- something that goats did quite often. However, the Romans saw this constellation not as a goatherd, but that of a charioteer driving 4 horses abreast. Although the depiction of the constellation in modern books is almost always given as the Roman charioteer, the ""goat"" names of the stars remained intact.Our first pony was a beautiful dappled gray, half-Thoroughbred mare. Born in 1966, this granddaughter of Man-of-War was the sweetest, most loving, and most talented creature I had ever known. She had come to me as a Western Pleasure show horse at age 9, and under my care added foxhunting, dressage, combined training, and finally driving, to her resume. She was without peer, and the highlight of our career together was showing at Dressage at Devon. Her registered name, however, was enough to make one cringe. So we re-christened her ""Capella"" --using the name of the alpha star of the Auriga constellation. Being so taken by this lovely mare, we decided to name our new farm after the constellation itself -- and thus ""Auriga Farm"" was born. All our Dorset sheep, and our Shetland Sheepdogs, carry this prefix, as do our Welsh ponies. Capella, affectionally nicknamed ""Dee"" (which was short for ""D.G."" which was short for dapple gray), was laid to rest at age 21 in 1987, yet her memory lives on in the name of our farm ... as it will forever in our lives.",,,,,,Breeding & Sales-Horses & Ponies,capella@crosslink.net

http://aurigafarm.8m.com/,Middleburg,Auriga Farm,"""Auriga"" (Awe-rye-gah) is a winter constellation in the northern hemisphere, and can be seen as a perfect pentagram of 5 stars directly overhead from the winter solstice to about mid-January .The name comes originally from the Greek constellation which was depicted as that of a Goatherd and his three kids. The alpha star was named ""Capella"", meaning to leap or frolic -- something that goats did quite often. However, the Romans saw this constellation not as a goatherd, but that of a charioteer driving 4 horses abreast. Although the depiction of the constellation in modern books is almost always given as the Roman charioteer, the ""goat"" names of the stars remained intact.Our first pony was a beautiful dappled gray, half-Thoroughbred mare. Born in 1966, this granddaughter of Man-of-War was the sweetest, most loving, and most talented creature I had ever known. She had come to me as a Western Pleasure show horse at age 9, and under my care added foxhunting, dressage, combined training, and finally driving, to her resume. She was without peer, and the highlight of our career together was showing at Dressage at Devon. Her registered name, however, was enough to make one cringe. So we re-christened her ""Capella"" --using the name of the alpha star of the Auriga constellation. Being so taken by this lovely mare, we decided to name our new farm after the constellation itself -- and thus ""Auriga Farm"" was born. All our Dorset sheep, and our Shetland Sheepdogs, carry this prefix, as do our Welsh ponies. Capella, affectionally nicknamed ""Dee"" (which was short for ""D.G."" which was short for dapple gray), was laid to rest at age 21 in 1987, yet her memory lives on in the name of our farm ... as it will forever in our lives.",,,,,,Carriage Service,capella@crosslink.net

http://www.birtwickparkstables.com,Farmville,Horses for Healing,"There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man - Winston ChurchillIts been said that horses can see through a person and read into your soul. Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us!

The mechanically Smart Rotary contains no wood to rot or splinter. Heavy duty truck bearings, 1/8 inch structural steel, and angle iron covered with high-density powder coating make for a long lasting machine.  The weight is evenly distributed on the four-wheeled frame. There is no weight on the hitch therefore requiring 1/2 the horse power to pull twice the weight.  User Smart!The Rotary Manure Spreader is completely user friendly! Hydraulic lifts help raise and hold the lid. The opening of the barrel can be positioned at any height to accommodate muck buckets, wheel barrows, and front end loaders.  Easily moved by hand when empty, and easy to hitch.If you are looking for a manure spreader of your own, consider the Rotary Spreader.  You'll be happy with the results!  We offer a variety of services for horse owners including reliable, affordable manure removal, spreading manure on your fields, bedding delivery (ask us about permanent bedding!), bush hogging, stone delivery, and other farm related services.  We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us! We've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it!) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help!BEDDINGWe provide 2 different types of bedding.  SAWDUSTFirst, we have sifted, white pine sawdust.  We have this product trucked in so even when local mills are not producing, we have sawdust available.  We can bring you a 16 cubic-yard bulk load (or an 8 cubic-foot half load) if you have a place to store bulk sawdust.  If you are not in the Northern Virginia area, we can arrange delivery of a semi tractor/trailer load (110 cubic-yards) to your facility.  Call us for a price!SHAVINGSSecond, we sell SUNCOAST Bedding.  This bedding is not a sawmill by-product (waste product of the lumber industry).  It is produced exclusively as animal bedding with appropriate quality control and standards guaranteed.  Each bag is ultra compressed for more bedding in each bale - the Large Flake bales provide ~10 Cubic Feet of expanded bedding and the Mini-Flake and Quarter Flake each expand to ~8 Cubic Feet. The bedding is screened multiple times to lower the amount of dust which also provides reliable quality of shavings. Since we use the products we sell, we can confidently say that this bedding is very consistent shipment after shipment. Also, their newest product, the Quarter Flake is a small flake (similar to what we used to sell) that sifts through your manure fork very easily. We also like the fact that SUNCOAST Bedding is a ""green company"". Of course, their product is natural and reclaimable. Additionally, any waste created in the manufacturing process is used to fuel their dryer burners...so nothing of the tree is wasted.MANURE REMOVALFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    If you have 5-9 horses at your place, we also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with a clean and empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are also photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. If you have a larger facility we can also arrange for a larger bin.  This will reduce the number of ""bin-swaps"" per month and help keep your costs down.Give us a call and we'll be glad to help!",20181,(703) 400-8446,VA,,Cleve Benton,Farm Equipment Sales,cleve@affordablemanureremoval.com

SHOEING & SCOTCH BOTTOMS:Though we prefer to leave pleasure horses, balanced and barefoot, as a breeder and exhibitor, we understand the need for shoeing in competitive horses.  As a Clydesdale breeder and national exhibitor, we specialize in the scotch bottom shoeing needs of drafts, and GENESIS FARRIERS CAN BE CONTRACTED TO FLY IN TO SHOE YOUR HITCH!!!!GENESIS HOOF CARE CENTER:Genesis Farriers specializes in balanced, equine podiatry style trimming. Dave has experience working with clients & veterinarians to treat a variety of hoof issues including coronary band/hoof lacerations, laminitic horses, abscesses, white line disease & more.  As horse lovers ourselves - we understand the difficult situation that working owners face if/when their horse requires daily hoof care to correct an issue.  Consequently, we now offer temporary board & care for your horse's hoof needs.  We work with your vet to administer wrapping, shoeing, trimming, holding/assisting for surgery and more.  Our goal is to provide quality hoof treatment for the horses in our care & peace of mind/stress relief for the horse's owner.GENESIS TRAINING:The more Dave learned about the practice of standard farriery, the more he realized that he wanted to go a different way.  Daves belief that proper trimming is the foundation for all hoof care ultimately led to the decision to attend class at the Institute of Applied Equine Podiatry in Ocala, Florida rather than a more traditional farrier school.Despite the course focus on balanced, barefoot trimming, Dave also understood the need for shoeing in competitive and corrective situations, knowledge which he gained by apprenticing locally with a master farrier in Middleburg, Virginia.GENESIS PHILOSOPHY:  At Genesis Farriers, we believe in handling horses with a kind but assertive manner, taking the time to bond with them and training them to submit to the farrier through trust.  We refrain from drugging horses, preferring to utilize a system of praise & discipline to help you train your horse to stand for a farrier visit. GENESIS CLIENTELE:Genesis Farriers handles all breeds of horses; however, as Clydesdale breeders, we have a particular love and interest in handling & dealing with the special needs of Drafts!!VISIT US ON-LINE athttp://www.genesisfarriers.comE-MAIL:  genesisfarmsllc@aol.com and your message will be forwarded to Genesis Farriers",22701,571-921-5822,VA,,Dave & Lisa Giza,Farriers,genesisfarmsllc@aol.com

,Henrico,Wild At Heart Barefoot Trimming LLC,"Natural barefoot trimming services for the equines of Central Virginia.My goal as a trimmer is to improve the soundness and health of your horse and allow their hooves to function properly as nature intended. I let the hoof show me how it needs to be trimmed to provide balance and the excellent performance it was designed for... naturally!I treat every hoof (and horse!) as an individual, and I understand that there are many factors that influence the soundness of your horse. I am happy to discuss not only hoof care, but riding, feeding, and housing with you in order to get your horse performing at its best.I will never shoe your horse. I only serve clients that desire their horses to live a more natural lifestyle by keeping them barefoot and providing them the proper diet and housing that is best for their well-being.Every trim I perform also includes a diet and lifestyle consultation in order to make your horse as comfortable, happy, and healthy as possible. I will also measure your horse's hooves for hoof boots in case you would like to try them (which I highly encourage, especially for the transitioning horse!). Please see below for pricing.Trim (Draft): $50Setup Trim (Average Horse/Donkey/Mule): $45Maintenance Trim (Average Horse/Donkey/Mule): $35Trim (Mini Horse/Donkey): $30Special/Severe Conditions: Priced individually, email meHoof Casting: $7/wrap (lasts approximately 4 weeks with average wear and tear, used primarily for rehabs)Vettec Products: determined by the amount of product used, or I will apply the product you bought for free (vettec.com)Miscellaneous Treatments: $5-15, by owner's requestTrip Charges: $1/mile, one way, for distances over 25 miles (from zip code 23238)***I am extremely patient and will spend as much time with your horse as it takes to provide the best trim possible, but extra fees apply for horses with behavioral issues, as these horses do put me and the handler at a greater risk of being injured. I reserve the right to decline to trim a horse for any reason, including but not limited to particularly dangerous behavior. Please contact me if you have any questions about this.***Horses coming out of shoes will require a setup trim. Maintenance trims are done on a schedule of up to 6 weeks. Some fairly healthy hooves can go six weeks, but most cannot. You will see significantly more and faster improvement with more frequent trims (~ 4-5 weeks). I am flexible with scheduling and can take clients at a variety of times.For more information or to set up an appointment, please email hoofmaiden13@gmail.com",23238,,VA,,Tatum Standley,Farriers,hoofmaiden13@gmail.com

I pride myself on patience and cooperation with the horse owners as well. It is a team effort to maintain your horses hoof care. The horse owner, farrier, vet, trainer, and anyone else involved with the horse must work together.

http://www.happyhorseproducts.us,palmyra,Happy Horse Products USA,"Steaming Hot new arrival to the USA!Few products have made more impact on the British equestrian market than the original range ofhay steamers from Happy Horse Products, and now two steamers from this innovative range areavailable in the USA.Winner of a 2007 British Equestrian Trade Association innovation award and nominated for the 2009Equitana innovation awards, these revolutionary Hay Steamers make the futility and inconvenienceassociated with soaking hay a thing of the past.The ideal solution for horses with dust allergies, respiratory conditions, or simply for owners wishingto help protect their horses lungs from dust and fungal spores, these easy to use systems aredesigned to do the same AND MORE as soaking hay, without the inconvenience of containers full ofwaste water and heavy, wet hay nets to hang up. Bacteria, fungal spores and dust mites are notkilled by simply soaking hay in cold water, leaving our horses exposed to many possible sources ofinfection. At the same time, soaking hay leads to loss of vital minerals that must be supplementedback into our horses diets at considerable expense.Easy to use and maintain, each Hay Steamer system introduces steam to the hay penetrating atapproximately 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees centigrade). Steaming at these temperaturesensures that the majority of fungal spores, bacteria and dust mites are destroyed and all potentiallyairborne dust particles are sufficiently dampened down and neutralized. The hay is then lush andready for your horse to enjoy, complete with all its vital minerals.Two Happy Horse Products Hay Steamer systems are now available in the USA atwww.happyhorseproducts.us - the Bale Buster and the Traveller.The Bale Buster Steamer system has a large capacity hay steam chamber capable of steamingone whole small bale at a time. Steam is introduced through multiple steam lance injectors,ensuring deep and thorough penetration through the entire bale. The steaming process takesapproximately 50 to 60 minutes. The Bale Buster can also handle flakes from large square or roundbales, as well as hay nets. The ideal solution for large stables or riding schools, the unit features aquick release steam generator coupling which allows the hay to be easily distributed once theprocess is complete. Also available is the ability to run from a central continuous steam generatorwith permanent water supply, facilitating the operation of multiple steam chambers, which areavailable on request.The Traveller Steamer is ideal for horse people on the go as it can be operated from a truckgenerator or hook up. No power at your stable? No problem. With the Traveller your hay net canbe steamed at home and easily transported to anywhere on the property.Happy Horse Products Hay Steamers are a healthy, easy, cost effective and environmentally friendlyway to prepare your hay.For more information visit www.happyhorseproducts.us",22963,434 262 8262,VA,,karin sclater,"Feed, Hay, & Bedding",karin@happyhorseproducts.us

http://www.airliteusa.com,Upperville,Airlite Bedding LLC,"Dust free bedding made from clean recycled cardboard. Superior cushion, absorption, and dust free bedding is recommended by vets and used in local equine hospitals. Helps eliminate respiratory problems and thrush. Bedding breaks down quickly and is great  for gardens. Check out the website or call local vendor David 540-687-0383 for more information and delivery.FAQSQ Are AirLite Corrugate Beddings Safe for Animals?A Yes. Sheep, goats, swine, cattle, Camelids, dogs, poultry, birds and pets are all safe on our products. They are all made from pre-consumer waste. The cardboard is composed of cooked-down (very short) wood fibers, held together by corn starch. It is totally benign to animal digestive systems and will not cause harm or impaction. This is backed by research from CSU, LSU and Texas A&M and 25+ years of use in Europe. Some animals may pick at or eat small amounts, but as a general rule they do not.Q How Does it Work?A Corrugate has a surface tension, allowing urine to flow through to the bottom and then be absorbed from the bottom up, greatly reducing ammonia levels in the stall or cage. Our products will hold up to three times their own weight in water.Q Why Should I Use AirLite Products?A They are from the ground up; simply the healthiest choice in bedding you can buy. Vets recommend them for hoof and lameness issues as well as respiratory problems. It is low in bacteria, so therefore also reduces the chance of infections and secondary infections after injury or surgery. They are mold and dust free. All of the above facts make it the absolute best bedding for birthing stalls and cages. It is also superb for large animal trailering.Q Are AirLite Products OK for the Environment?A Yes! Our products compost nicely in 4-6 weeks vs. 14 months or more for pine shavings. All our bedding products are compliant with EPA 916-F-01-026 (4606): Managing Livestock, Poultry and Horse Waste to Prevent Contamination of Drinking Water.",20185,540-687-0383,VA,P.O.

Over the years we have managed to maintain prices which are affordable to everyone.   Our other goal was to provide a facility for equine rescue.  We have saved a number of horses and provided or found loving homes for them.  Some of them are still used as lesson mounts. As well as beautiful trails & guided trail rides, hauling, and a wide variety of wonderful horses at all price ranges for everyone.Beginner lessons focus on the fundamentals:  developing balance, good hand control, leg and seat aids, grooming, and walking and trotting.  Lessons initially take place in our riding ring.  As the student progresses, lessons are occasionally given on trails to help the student gain mastery of obstacles, crossing streams, opening and closing gates, etc.Intermediate lessons help the rider to advance their level of horesemanship skills, focusing on a balanced seat, & becoming comfortable in specific disciplines:  hunt seat, jumping , western pleasure, pleasure and trail riding.There are always those horses that change your life in one way or another. I have met hundreds & have seen thousands.  Some slaughterhouse-bound starvation cases, that nobody would think twice about killing, only because they looked like death. Racetrack rejects that just did not have the heart to run or the ones that did and could not stop, causing themselves irreversible damage.  The horse that is afraid to be touched because time and time again they were punished for just being a horse. These are just some of the horror stories that the horses have lived in the past.  Here at Griffinsburg Equine Center, they are my most cherished and the opportunity to overcome their fears.

These acts of cruelty range from days with no contact or affection to severe beatings and starvation. Some forms of abuse are intentional, while neglect often stems from owners who, despite their love for their pets, may be physically or financially unable to care for the animals they own. Regardless of the reasons for abuse or neglect, the animals still suffer physically, mentally, and emotionally. Abused animals become very withdrawn, fearful of the world around them. Noah's Station is an equine rescue located in the beautiful mountains of southwest Virginia. Abused and neglected horses receive the care and attention they need in order to enjoy life. After rehabilitation and training, these horses are adopted out to qualified families. At Noah's Station, we understand the damage abuse and neglect causes to all levels of an animal's being. Our staff combines time and patience with compassion and understanding to help abused animals heal.

http://www.msshelleysponyschool.com,Berryville,Ms. Shelley's Pony School,"Pony School is offered in sessions consisting of four one-hour parent and child classes.  Each class includes stories, songs, hands-on activities, a horse lesson, a craft/manipulative, and a short riding lesson.  Children learn a wide range of information about ponies/horses, have fun, become more confident and comfortable around ponies, and gradually learn to control the pony at the walk.  This is an ideal program for small children who are fearful around large animals, but will also provide enough hands-on time to please children more eager to interact with the horses. Some specific topics that may be covered include: What do horses eat? How do horses tell us how they are feeling? How do we take care of horses? What do horses like to do? How do we tell the horses what we want them to do? What makes horses happy and healthy? How do we keep horses clean and shiny? What kinds of equipment do we need to ride? What colors are the horses and how do we tell whos who? How do we talk our parents into buying us a pony? Okay, not really : )Sessions begin at the start of each month. Each 4-week session costs $50. There is a sibling discount of $10 off the second enrollment fee when both children are enrolled for the same session. Helmets will be provided, but parents may want to consider purchasing one for their child if they have concerns about sharing helmets. Helmets will be required when children are on the pony. Parents should keep in mind that children will probably get dirty (maybe very dirty!) at Pony School and should remember this when dressing their child. Children will need to wear long pants and closed-toe shoes.  Because of the types of activities involved, and the inherent risks of having small children around horses, an adult should be present at all times with each child.The classes take place at Evergreen Farm in Berryville, VA and Majestic Reins Stables in Shenandoah Junction, WV (more info on the facilities and directions at www.evergreenfarm.info and www.majesticreinsstable.com).

http://www.griffinsburgequine.com,Boston,Griffinsburg Equine,"We established Griffinsburg Equine for the purpose of providing high quality riding instruction with the a family atomosphere.  Over the years we have managed to maintain prices which are affordable to everyone.   Our other goal was to provide a facility for equine rescue.  We have saved a number of horses and provided or found loving homes for them.  Some of them are still used as lesson mounts. As well as beautiful trails & guided trail rides, hauling, and a wide variety of wonderful horses at all price ranges for everyone.Beginner lessons focus on the fundamentals:  developing balance, good hand control, leg and seat aids, grooming, and walking and trotting.  Lessons initially take place in our riding ring.  As the student progresses, lessons are occasionally given on trails to help the student gain mastery of obstacles, crossing streams, opening and closing gates, etc.Intermediate lessons help the rider to advance their level of horesemanship skills, focusing on a balanced seat, & becoming comfortable in specific disciplines:  hunt seat, jumping , western pleasure, pleasure and trail riding.There are always those horses that change your life in one way or another. I have met hundreds & have seen thousands.  Some slaughterhouse-bound starvation cases, that nobody would think twice about killing, only because they looked like death. Racetrack rejects that just did not have the heart to run or the ones that did and could not stop, causing themselves irreversible damage.  The horse that is afraid to be touched because time and time again they were punished for just being a horse. These are just some of the horror stories that the horses have lived in the past.  Here at Griffinsburg Equine Center, they are my most cherished and the opportunity to overcome their fears.  Most importantly, to live out the rest of their lives, with a ton of love; full of hope and new professions.",22713,540-547-2973,VA,6061 Griffinsburg Rd,Jill Weber,Instructions & Training,vahunterjumperrider@yahoo.com

http://www.birtwickparkstables.com,Farmville,Horses for Healing,"There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man - Winston ChurchillIts been said that horses can see through a person and read into your soul. Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us! We would love to hear from you.We look forward to healing with you!",23901,434-808-4763,VA,,Allie Sinclair,Instructions & Training,Allie.sowden87@me.com

,Gloucester,Hawk Equestrian,"I just moved to the area from Knoxville, TN where I freelanced as a Professional Horse/Pony trainer. My background is in the Hunter/Jumper world. I also have some experience with driving carriages and harness horses, as well as some gaited horses. I grew up around horses and got my first pony at the age of 5 and have been riding ever since. I am now 28 years old. I graduated from Virginia Intermont College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Equine Studies in 2003. I have spent the past 5 years working as a Professional trainer. I've reformed many a horse and pony with bucking, rearing, and a host of other issues. I am 4'11"" and weigh 80 lbs. so I am small enough to ride the smallest of smalls, yet experienced enough and strong enough to ride the biggest and toughest of them all.

Her goal is to provide the horses she works with a solid foundation that will stay with them, independent of discipline specific training.  Putting training on a horse serves no purpose if the owner has no idea what's been done.  Before a horse comes to Leslie, the owner has to agree to come out and work with the horse for a couple of days at the end of the training so that they know how the horse has been worked.  By doing this, the owner learns the exercises the horse has learned.  They also learn tools to help them correct problems that may surface and they will have the skills to continue the training with the horse.  There are three basic rules that she follows:  she can't get hurt, the horse can't get hurt and the horse must be calmer at the end of the lesson.Leslie offers the following training services:One time training sessionsStarting an unbroke (allow 2 days)Trailer LoadingMonthly Training (4 weeks)Two-Week Tune UpGround Manners (2 weeks)LessonsWebsite:  www.milesofsmilestraining.com",20180,540 882 3697,VA,40563 Featherbed Lane,Leslie Gottesman,Instructions & Training,Leslie@milesofsmilestraining.com

I have been riding and training horses for over 12 years now using Natural Horsemanship and have extensive training in the Parelli Natural Horsemanship method**. I spent 3 months at the Parelli Center in Colorado with my horse, Breeze, in 2006 for an intensive study of Natural Horsemanship. I have also studied levels 1 through 4 of the Parelli home study system, as well as taking lessons and learning from some wonderful instructors and trainers over the years. I provide training to young horses, un-started horses, and ""problem"" horses using Natural Horsemanship methods that communicate to horses in their own language so that training is fun and non-stressful. I also provide both riding lessons and training instruction to owners who want a great relationship and better communication with their horses, whether they are just starting out and learning riding and groundwork basics or whether they are competent and want to advance their skills. If you do not have your own horse I have two lesson horses available to learn on at a lovely farm in Warrenton, VA.Natural Horsemanship training benefits all horses of all disciplines  English or Western.  It improves a horses confidence and responsiveness in the show-ring and out on the trail. A horse that trusts and understands you and is confident in your leadership is something truly special and ANY horse can learn to be this way, if the human learns their language and learns to understand them.Once you have a relationship with your horse, once you have a horse that wants to be with you, and wants to do things for you, no goal is unachieveable, and no dream is too big. The sky is the limit to what you can do!Feel free contact me by email or phone for more information. I can also mail you a flyer to post at your barn. I also offer free demonstrations or consultations for people or barns who are interested but want to see what I have to offer in person first.I live in the Gainesville/Haymarket area and travel throughout Loudoun, Fauquier, and Prince William county.

http://www.whispertraining.com,Manassas,Whisper Training,"My name is Rebekah Nelson and I am the owner of Whisper Training. I have been riding and training horses for over 12 years now using Natural Horsemanship and have extensive training in the Parelli Natural Horsemanship method**. I spent 3 months at the Parelli Center in Colorado with my horse, Breeze, in 2006 for an intensive study of Natural Horsemanship. I have also studied levels 1 through 4 of the Parelli home study system, as well as taking lessons and learning from some wonderful instructors and trainers over the years. I provide training to young horses, un-started horses, and ""problem"" horses using Natural Horsemanship methods that communicate to horses in their own language so that training is fun and non-stressful. I also provide both riding lessons and training instruction to owners who want a great relationship and better communication with their horses, whether they are just starting out and learning riding and groundwork basics or whether they are competent and want to advance their skills. If you do not have your own horse I have two lesson horses available to learn on at a lovely farm in Warrenton, VA.Natural Horsemanship training benefits all horses of all disciplines  English or Western.  It improves a horses confidence and responsiveness in the show-ring and out on the trail. A horse that trusts and understands you and is confident in your leadership is something truly special and ANY horse can learn to be this way, if the human learns their language and learns to understand them.Once you have a relationship with your horse, once you have a horse that wants to be with you, and wants to do things for you, no goal is unachieveable, and no dream is too big. The sky is the limit to what you can do!Feel free contact me by email or phone for more information. I can also mail you a flyer to post at your barn. I also offer free demonstrations or consultations for people or barns who are interested but want to see what I have to offer in person first.I live in the Gainesville/Haymarket area and travel throughout Loudoun, Fauquier, and Prince William county.

http://www.birtwickparkstables.com,Farmville,Horses for Healing,"There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man - Winston ChurchillIts been said that horses can see through a person and read into your soul. Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us!

http://www.NokesvilleHorseSociety.org,Nokesville,Nokesville Horse Society,"Vision StatementThe Nokesville Horse Society is a service organization committed to the promotion of equestrian activities for the enjoyment and recreation of all residents of Northern Virginia. Mission StatementThe Nokesville Horse Society is dedicated to the improvement and preservation of the equestrian community in Northern Virginia. In the face of urban growth, we will unite with both public and private organizations to become a leader in the development and maintenance of Northern Virginia equestrian trails and facilities; endeavoring to function as a bridge between development and preservation, promoting greenways and facilities for the equestrian community and general public use. We are resolved to keeping the horse in the horse community! NHS HistoryThe Nokesville Horse Society was formed in January 2001. The group assembled with a common interest in creating lasting relationships among horse enthusiasts in the greater Prince William County area. The membership quickly grew to encompass equestrians in neighboring counties of Fauquier, Loudoun, Fairfax, Warren and others. Current president of the organization, Jeff Shoup of Gainesville VA, says ""We all have a common goal to protect our community values and way of life. The equestrian community is a big part of our overall community. Our partnership with our communities will help us keep the horse in the horse community. Living and working in the Northern Virginia region for over 20 years I have seen so many changes. We can't prevent change but we can strive to coexist with it. We are dedicated to being an organization that will work with inevitable growth so we can continue to enjoy our favorite recreation and equine related businesses."" In addition to being a community service organization, the NHS is committed to education and having fun! Each monthly meeting usually has a guest speaker to talk about current interests of the equestrian. Events throughout the year include the ""Farm & Family Day"", the big winter Tack Swap, Judged Trail Rides, Schooling Shows, ""Gymkhanas"" (games on horseback) and plenty of trail rides.

Competitions are conducted much like the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association in that owning a horse is not necessary.  Riders randomly draw horses at the beginning of each show and will be given a brief warm up before competing.  Though the rider and horse have a short opportunity at orientation in the over fences classes, the horse is new to the rider, and the scores are based upon horsemanship and equitation, not the horse.  This style of competition is designed to challenge the rider and is a wonderful opportunity for those interested in eventually riding on a college team.  Coach Dana Kiser established the Foxtail Farm Equestrian Team in 2011.  Despite being a first year team, Foxtail Farm riders qualified for the 2012 IEA Regional Finals, Zone Finals and IEA Nationals. The team tripled in size in 2012-13 to 40 members, joining ranks with Hampton Roads Academy's team. Riders again qualified for Regional, Zones and had a National Champion from the Middle School Team!!

Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us! We would love to hear from you.We look forward to healing with you!",23901,434-808-4763,VA,,Allie Sinclair,Other,Allie.sowden87@me.com

We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us! We've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it!) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help!BEDDINGWe provide 2 different types of bedding.  SAWDUSTFirst, we have sifted, white pine sawdust.  We have this product trucked in so even when local mills are not producing, we have sawdust available.  We can bring you a 16 cubic-yard bulk load (or an 8 cubic-foot half load) if you have a place to store bulk sawdust.  If you are not in the Northern Virginia area, we can arrange delivery of a semi tractor/trailer load (110 cubic-yards) to your facility.  Call us for a price!SHAVINGSSecond, we sell SUNCOAST Bedding.  This bedding is not a sawmill by-product (waste product of the lumber industry).  It is produced exclusively as animal bedding with appropriate quality control and standards guaranteed.  Each bag is ultra compressed for more bedding in each bale - the Large Flake bales provide ~10 Cubic Feet of expanded bedding and the Mini-Flake and Quarter Flake each expand to ~8 Cubic Feet. The bedding is screened multiple times to lower the amount of dust which also provides reliable quality of shavings. Since we use the products we sell, we can confidently say that this bedding is very consistent shipment after shipment. Also, their newest product, the Quarter Flake is a small flake (similar to what we used to sell) that sifts through your manure fork very easily. We also like the fact that SUNCOAST Bedding is a ""green company"". Of course, their product is natural and reclaimable. Additionally, any waste created in the manufacturing process is used to fuel their dryer burners...so nothing of the tree is wasted.MANURE REMOVALFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    If you have 5-9 horses at your place, we also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with a clean and empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are also photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. If you have a larger facility we can also arrange for a larger bin.  This will reduce the number of ""bin-swaps"" per month and help keep your costs down.MANURE SPREADERWe also have a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.

http://www.gearclean.com,Winchester,GearClean,"USE GEARCLEAN TO CLEAN AND REPAIR YOUR HORSE BLANKETS!Its very important to routinely wash horse blankets because the ammonias found in urine and manure act like acid on fabric, dramatically reducing its life and strength. Many people also store dirty blankets over the summer when they arent needed. Equestrian equipment may be more susceptible to molds and other bacteria than a lot of other sports equipment because, in addition to the normal sweat, the equipment and blankets are often used in inclement weather conditions and stored in barns that tend to be dampa perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that cause staph infections. Regular cleaning and sanitizing equestrian equipment is important to the health of both the horse and its rider. A horse blanket is only as good as its ability to repel elements such as rain and snow. Repeated laundering of horse blankets disables the factory-manufactured water repellency. Our optional Dry Barrier Wash provides extra, long-lasting protection against the elements, penetrating deep into the fibers and restoring the repellent characteristics of the blanket.We will pick up and drop off your blanket for free within a 20 mile radius of Winchester, VA.

http://www.eqsportsmassage.com,Afton,equine sports massage,"Equine massage is an extremely effective way to improve a horse's performance. Most athletic training programs emphasize building strength, speed and endurance. However, as training progresses, a horse loses flexibility and tends to develop muscle tension. Tighter muscles shorten his stride, restricting the natural flowing gaits, often causing resistance to training. Poor performance is a natural result of discomfort. It is unrealistic to expect performance from a horse that is in pain. Unfortunately, in the horse industry today, pain management is common practice and thoughtful, caring horsemanship is a dying art. Equine therapeutic massage increases performance level and endurance and assists in the prevention of debilitating muscular injuries, and in speeding injury recovery time among equine athletes. Additionally, equine sports and therapeutic massage are empirically proven to effect change in problem behaviors related to hidden pain and stiffness. As a professional massage practitioner with a thorough understanding of equine anatomy and biomechanics, I employ the proven physical therapy of massage in combination with Linda Tellington-Jones' TTouch, Young Living Essential Oils, and the knowledge I have gained through many years' study of natural horsemanship. I specialize in equine massage and bodywork for horses of all disciplines using these specially targeted modalities for treating common problems associated with riding and training. This synthesis of touch modalities provides a rich and varied inventory of tools for treating behavioral issues, musculoskeletal problems, and retraining horses' muscle memory for more efficient and pain-free action. Anything less than maximum musculoskeletal efficiency can lead to problems in performance or even injury. Athletes perform better when they move better.Any muscle that isn't working for your horse is working against him. The greatest gift you can give your horse is ease and freedom of motion. TREAT YOUR HORSES LIKE THE ATHLETES THEY ARE!",22920,434-882-3150,VA,2133 Craigs Store Road,Kimberly Cox Carneal,Services & Products,esm@fastermac.net

http://www.jrlandworks.com/,Aldie,JR Landworks LLC,"JR Landworks is a pioneer in the advanced land clearing process know as forestry mowing or mulching in Virginia and surrounding states. Forestry mowing or mulching is the process of using a heavy duty mower to grind up brush and trees up to 10 inches in diameter to clear land. This method is more environmentally responsible compared to conventional clearing methods because it leaves the mulch and roots in place which helps to reduce soil erosion and adds nutrients back into the soil. At JR Landworks we utilize a one hundred horse power Terex mulching machine with rubber tracks which only produce 3.5 PSI of ground pressure. This decreases soil compaction and also allows us to reach sensitive or soft locations other machines are unable to. Forestry mowing is ideal for fence line clearing, trail construction, and total reduction of burn/ brush piles.

http://www.uncommontouch.info,Amissville,UnCommon Touch,"The work I do with animals and humans is very similar.  I work intuitively, sometimes with a focus on a particular issueinjury, illness, emotions.  Other times, I just get out of the way and let the energy work its magic.  There is no modality or methodology.  I just bring a Gift that effects mind, body and spirit in miraculous ways. A key difference when working with animals is communication.  Humans, generally speaking, have a pretty good grasp of whats going on with them and can share verbally. With horses and other four-legged friends, things are a little different.  Human companions can share with me a veterinarians diagnosis or describe symptoms. Sometimes they are right but, again, generally speaking, thats not the entire picture.  So, when working with animals I listen.  Im not an animal communicator in the sense that most people presume one to be.  I just listen with all of my senses and allow an animals response to me and the energy guide how I move and breathe.  There are those who attempt to explain how the energy works.  The truth is, no one knows.  In my case, the only thing I know is that it does work. It works on dramatically shortening recovery time after acute injury; elimination of chronic injury and illness; emotional & physical trauma; behavioral issues for which no one else has found solutions.  I cant explain it and dont go looking for the how or why.  I just watch lame and wild horses transform into healthy, happy, active creatures.  I see paralyzed pooches wag, walk and otherwise be hale and hearty.The fee for animal work (including distance healing) is $85 for one hour.For testimonials, please go to: http://www.uncommontouch.info/UnCommonTouch.com/Animal_Work.html",20106,540-316-8034,VA,742 South Poes Road,Ingrid Oliphant,Services & Products,ingrdo@gmail.com

http://www.griffinsburgequine.com,Boston,Griffinsburg Equine,"We established Griffinsburg Equine for the purpose of providing high quality riding instruction with the a family atomosphere.  Over the years we have managed to maintain prices which are affordable to everyone.   Our other goal was to provide a facility for equine rescue.  We have saved a number of horses and provided or found loving homes for them.  Some of them are still used as lesson mounts. As well as beautiful trails & guided trail rides, hauling, and a wide variety of wonderful horses at all price ranges for everyone.Beginner lessons focus on the fundamentals:  developing balance, good hand control, leg and seat aids, grooming, and walking and trotting.  Lessons initially take place in our riding ring.  As the student progresses, lessons are occasionally given on trails to help the student gain mastery of obstacles, crossing streams, opening and closing gates, etc.Intermediate lessons help the rider to advance their level of horesemanship skills, focusing on a balanced seat, & becoming comfortable in specific disciplines:  hunt seat, jumping , western pleasure, pleasure and trail riding.There are always those horses that change your life in one way or another. I have met hundreds & have seen thousands.  Some slaughterhouse-bound starvation cases, that nobody would think twice about killing, only because they looked like death. Racetrack rejects that just did not have the heart to run or the ones that did and could not stop, causing themselves irreversible damage.  The horse that is afraid to be touched because time and time again they were punished for just being a horse. These are just some of the horror stories that the horses have lived in the past.  Here at Griffinsburg Equine Center, they are my most cherished and the opportunity to overcome their fears.  Most importantly, to live out the rest of their lives, with a ton of love; full of hope and new professions.",22713,540-547-2973,VA,6061 Griffinsburg Rd,Jill Weber,Services & Products,vahunterjumperrider@yahoo.com

http://www.birtwickparkstables.com,Farmville,Horses for Healing,"There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man - Winston ChurchillIts been said that horses can see through a person and read into your soul. Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us! We would love to hear from you.We look forward to healing with you!",23901,434-808-4763,VA,,Allie Sinclair,Services & Products,Allie.sowden87@me.com

We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us! We've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it!) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help!BEDDINGWe provide 2 different types of bedding.  SAWDUSTFirst, we have sifted, white pine sawdust.  We have this product trucked in so even when local mills are not producing, we have sawdust available.  We can bring you a 16 cubic-yard bulk load (or an 8 cubic-foot half load) if you have a place to store bulk sawdust.  If you are not in the Northern Virginia area, we can arrange delivery of a semi tractor/trailer load (110 cubic-yards) to your facility.  Call us for a price!SHAVINGSSecond, we sell SUNCOAST Bedding.  This bedding is not a sawmill by-product (waste product of the lumber industry).  It is produced exclusively as animal bedding with appropriate quality control and standards guaranteed.  Each bag is ultra compressed for more bedding in each bale - the Large Flake bales provide ~10 Cubic Feet of expanded bedding and the Mini-Flake and Quarter Flake each expand to ~8 Cubic Feet. The bedding is screened multiple times to lower the amount of dust which also provides reliable quality of shavings. Since we use the products we sell, we can confidently say that this bedding is very consistent shipment after shipment. Also, their newest product, the Quarter Flake is a small flake (similar to what we used to sell) that sifts through your manure fork very easily. We also like the fact that SUNCOAST Bedding is a ""green company"". Of course, their product is natural and reclaimable. Additionally, any waste created in the manufacturing process is used to fuel their dryer burners...so nothing of the tree is wasted.MANURE REMOVALFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    If you have 5-9 horses at your place, we also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with a clean and empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are also photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. If you have a larger facility we can also arrange for a larger bin.  This will reduce the number of ""bin-swaps"" per month and help keep your costs down.MANURE SPREADERWe also have a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.  This revolutionary manure spreader breaks the manure into tiny pieces as you spread, offering an even, easily absorbed distribution of organic fertilizer to your fields.  You can see the 5 foot wide path of evenly spread manure behind the spreader.

http://www.gearclean.com,Winchester,GearClean,"USE GEARCLEAN TO CLEAN AND REPAIR YOUR HORSE BLANKETS!Its very important to routinely wash horse blankets because the ammonias found in urine and manure act like acid on fabric, dramatically reducing its life and strength. Many people also store dirty blankets over the summer when they arent needed. Equestrian equipment may be more susceptible to molds and other bacteria than a lot of other sports equipment because, in addition to the normal sweat, the equipment and blankets are often used in inclement weather conditions and stored in barns that tend to be dampa perfect breeding ground for the bacteria that cause staph infections. Regular cleaning and sanitizing equestrian equipment is important to the health of both the horse and its rider. A horse blanket is only as good as its ability to repel elements such as rain and snow. Repeated laundering of horse blankets disables the factory-manufactured water repellency. Our optional Dry Barrier Wash provides extra, long-lasting protection against the elements, penetrating deep into the fibers and restoring the repellent characteristics of the blanket.We will pick up and drop off your blanket for free within a 20 mile radius of Winchester, VA. Pickup and delivery can be arranged for further distances, please call for prices. Typical turnaround is 48 hours (cleaning only). We are happy to work with you for faster turnaround if needed.

http://www.noahsstation.com/,Woodlawn,Noah's Station Equine Rescue,"Hope for abused and neglected horses Every day in America, thousands of animals are abused or neglected. These acts of cruelty range from days with no contact or affection to severe beatings and starvation. Some forms of abuse are intentional, while neglect often stems from owners who, despite their love for their pets, may be physically or financially unable to care for the animals they own. Regardless of the reasons for abuse or neglect, the animals still suffer physically, mentally, and emotionally. Abused animals become very withdrawn, fearful of the world around them. Noah's Station is an equine rescue located in the beautiful mountains of southwest Virginia. Abused and neglected horses receive the care and attention they need in order to enjoy life. After rehabilitation and training, these horses are adopted out to qualified families. At Noah's Station, we understand the damage abuse and neglect causes to all levels of an animal's being. Our staff combines time and patience with compassion and understanding to help abused animals heal. Medical, physical and mental areas are addressed in order to rebuild confidence and trust as well as good health.",24381,276-728-2096,VA,,Suzie Thompkins,Services & Products,noahstn@swva.net

http://www.whispertraining.com,Manassas,Whisper Training,"My name is Rebekah Nelson and I am the owner of Whisper Training. I have been riding and training horses for over 12 years now using Natural Horsemanship and have extensive training in the Parelli Natural Horsemanship method**. I spent 3 months at the Parelli Center in Colorado with my horse, Breeze, in 2006 for an intensive study of Natural Horsemanship. I have also studied levels 1 through 4 of the Parelli home study system, as well as taking lessons and learning from some wonderful instructors and trainers over the years. I provide training to young horses, un-started horses, and ""problem"" horses using Natural Horsemanship methods that communicate to horses in their own language so that training is fun and non-stressful. I also provide both riding lessons and training instruction to owners who want a great relationship and better communication with their horses, whether they are just starting out and learning riding and groundwork basics or whether they are competent and want to advance their skills. If you do not have your own horse I have two lesson horses available to learn on at a lovely farm in Warrenton, VA.Natural Horsemanship training benefits all horses of all disciplines  English or Western.  It improves a horses confidence and responsiveness in the show-ring and out on the trail. A horse that trusts and understands you and is confident in your leadership is something truly special and ANY horse can learn to be this way, if the human learns their language and learns to understand them.Once you have a relationship with your horse, once you have a horse that wants to be with you, and wants to do things for you, no goal is unachieveable, and no dream is too big. The sky is the limit to what you can do!Feel free contact me by email or phone for more information. I can also mail you a flyer to post at your barn. I also offer free demonstrations or consultations for people or barns who are interested but want to see what I have to offer in person first.I live in the Gainesville/Haymarket area and travel throughout Loudoun, Fauquier, and Prince William county.

,Fairfax,Essential Equine Balance - Certified ESMT,"Equine Sport Massage Therapy is a muscle treatment that is only beneficial for the horse and rider.  If your horse is having soundness issues, behavior problems, or soreness after activity massage may help.  Alleviating these frustrations will make the equestrian experience much more enjoyable for the rider.  The results will be immediate, dramatic, and lasting if there is an existing muscle related problem.  Benefits include aiding in the prevention of injuries, healing injuries faster, alleviating pain, enhancing muscle tone, increasing range of motion, stimulating the lymphatic system which helps the immune system to work at full capacity, and generally improving the disposition of the animal.

http://www.birtwickparkstables.com,Farmville,Horses for Healing,"There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man - Winston ChurchillIts been said that horses can see through a person and read into your soul. Horses have the ability to sense your every emotion and they require that you be both honest and vulnerable. A horse has beauty, power and grace. It has the incredible ability to heal individuals who find themselves broken. Horses do not pass judgment or discriminate and they are the first ones to show you their love. The Horses for Healing program is an opportunity for people to experience this amazing love, firsthand. There are other programs around the world that offer people the chance to heal with horses, but what makes this program unique is that these horses have needed to heal, as well. I have teamed up with the White Bird Appaloosa Horse Rescue to bring this program to our community, to help people recover from their personal histories of abuse (mental, physical and sexual), bullying and other kinds of violence. I have developed this program to help others who have been or who are currently going through the same things I have experiencedIf you or someone you know is currently or has been bullied or experienced some form of violence in their life and want to try a non traditional form of healing, please contact us!

http://www.firemansrunfarm.com,Lanexa,FIREMAN'S RUN FARM,"Training at Fireman's Run Farm Here at Firemans Run Farm, we have a very different approach to our clients training needs. We like to work in conjunction with your primary trainer (if you have one) to insure that we start your young horse as close as possible to your own trainers, and your needs, wants, and desires for your horse, also if your horses personality, and athleticism allows for the specified training. We realizes that your trainers may not have the time to do all the ground work necessary to get your young horse prepared to ride, and we understand that training is their lively hood and may not want to take the chance of getting them or you hurt. This is why we offer this type of approach to training. We are not here to compete with other trainers, but to work along side them for the best interest of their clients and horses. There fore our services take the hardest and the most time consuming part out of preparedness training for the both of you. Even if you have a horse that has any sort of bad vices such as, tying, bathing, clipping, saddling, bridling or loading we also offer retraining services for these types of problem horses. We take the time to desensitize our training horses to make training and riding easier and more enjoyable for you. That is why we recommend starting the training process from foal to 3 years old. These are the most impressionable ages for working with horses to prevent bad habits and vices from starting. They learn to trust and want to work for you, when the time is slowly taken to partner up with the horse. We offer reasonable board combined with training packages, for each individual client and horses needs. Please feel free to contact us for more information. We are located in Lanexa (New Kent) Virginia, which is 25 minutes from Williamsburg, and 45 minutes from Richmond. Our farm is nestled on a quiet stretch of road just a stones  throw from the Beautiful Chickahominy River. We offer services for the young horse, from foal to 3 years old. We specialize in imprinting our foals and yours, In-hand training for show, ground manners, starting young horses under saddle, and round pen training, also quality, reasonable board for foaling mares. We have two 14 x 12 video monitored foaling stalls, and four 12x12 mated stalls. With 12 acres in beautiful board fenced pastures. 60 foot round pen for starting and teaching young horses under saddle and lounging. Our 80 x 100 schooling ring is just the right size so the horses we start have room to move out but little room to run away with us. Since we are a small training facility we are able to tailor training to the individual needs of the horse and owner. Each horse is very different and we train according to their personalities. What may work for some, may not work for others? We never rush training at Firemans Run. We believe that each horse learns at their own pace, such as children. Training the young horse to be your partner is the foundation for future training with them. We also, strongly believe in making training fun!, We want the young horses to want to please, and be willing to work, there fore we produce a strong work ethic in our young training horses. Our motto is ""Be your horses' partner, not his adversary"". Teaching the young horse to respect you on the ground lays the foundation for them to respect you on their back.Tracey Leftwich",23089,757) 876-7705,VA,1360 Riverside Drive,Tracey Leftwich,Training,tracey@firemansrunfarm.com

http://www.milesofsmilestraining.com,Lovettsville,Miles of Smiles Training,"Leslie strongly believes that the foundation to a solid relationship with any horse is built upon clear communication, mutual respect and trust.  Her goal is to provide the horses she works with a solid foundation that will stay with them, independent of discipline specific training.  Putting training on a horse serves no purpose if the owner has no idea what's been done.  Before a horse comes to Leslie, the owner has to agree to come out and work with the horse for a couple of days at the end of the training so that they know how the horse has been worked.  By doing this, the owner learns the exercises the horse has learned.  They also learn tools to help them correct problems that may surface and they will have the skills to continue the training with the horse.  There are three basic rules that she follows:  she can't get hurt, the horse can't get hurt and the horse must be calmer at the end of the lesson.Leslie offers the following training services:One time training sessionsStarting an unbroke (allow 2 days)Trailer LoadingMonthly Training (4 weeks)Two-Week Tune UpGround Manners (2 weeks)LessonsWebsite:  www.milesofsmilestraining.com",20180,540 882 3697,VA,40563 Featherbed Lane,Leslie Gottesman,Training,Leslie@milesofsmilestraining.com

http://www.whispertraining.com,Manassas,Whisper Training,"My name is Rebekah Nelson and I am the owner of Whisper Training. I have been riding and training horses for over 12 years now using Natural Horsemanship and have extensive training in the Parelli Natural Horsemanship method**. I spent 3 months at the Parelli Center in Colorado with my horse, Breeze, in 2006 for an intensive study of Natural Horsemanship. I have also studied levels 1 through 4 of the Parelli home study system, as well as taking lessons and learning from some wonderful instructors and trainers over the years. I provide training to young horses, un-started horses, and ""problem"" horses using Natural Horsemanship methods that communicate to horses in their own language so that training is fun and non-stressful. I also provide both riding lessons and training instruction to owners who want a great relationship and better communication with their horses, whether they are just starting out and learning riding and groundwork basics or whether they are competent and want to advance their skills. If you do not have your own horse I have two lesson horses available to learn on at a lovely farm in Warrenton, VA.Natural Horsemanship training benefits all horses of all disciplines  English or Western.  It improves a horses confidence and responsiveness in the show-ring and out on the trail. A horse that trusts and understands you and is confident in your leadership is something truly special and ANY horse can learn to be this way, if the human learns their language and learns to understand them.Once you have a relationship with your horse, once you have a horse that wants to be with you, and wants to do things for you, no goal is unachieveable, and no dream is too big. The sky is the limit to what you can do!Feel free contact me by email or phone for more information. I can also mail you a flyer to post at your barn. I also offer free demonstrations or consultations for people or barns who are interested but want to see what I have to offer in person first.I live in the Gainesville/Haymarket area and travel throughout Loudoun, Fauquier, and Prince William county.

These acts of cruelty range from days with no contact or affection to severe beatings and starvation. Some forms of abuse are intentional, while neglect often stems from owners who, despite their love for their pets, may be physically or financially unable to care for the animals they own. Regardless of the reasons for abuse or neglect, the animals still suffer physically, mentally, and emotionally. Abused animals become very withdrawn, fearful of the world around them. Noah's Station is an equine rescue located in the beautiful mountains of southwest Virginia. Abused and neglected horses receive the care and attention they need in order to enjoy life. After rehabilitation and training, these horses are adopted out to qualified families. At Noah's Station, we understand the damage abuse and neglect causes to all levels of an animal's being. Our staff combines time and patience with compassion and understanding to help abused animals heal.

http://www.affordablemanureremoval.com,Nokesville,Affordable Manure Removal,"We offer a variety of services for horse owners including reliable, affordable manure removal, spreading manure on your fields, bedding delivery (ask us about permanent bedding!), bush hogging, stone delivery, and other farm related services.  We are also the area representatives for the Rotary Manure Spreaders so if you are interested in having one of your own, feel free to contact us! We've built our farm from scratch (it was literally a junk yard when we bought it!) and we can provide advice and assistance on subjects such as building an arena, use of a sacrifice area and rotating pastures, time-saving ideas for barn design and building, fencing, etc...  If you have a need for work around your farm, talk to us about it and we just might be able to help!BEDDINGWe provide 2 different types of bedding.  SAWDUSTFirst, we have sifted, white pine sawdust.  We have this product trucked in so even when local mills are not producing, we have sawdust available.  We can bring you a 16 cubic-yard bulk load (or an 8 cubic-foot half load) if you have a place to store bulk sawdust.  If you are not in the Northern Virginia area, we can arrange delivery of a semi tractor/trailer load (110 cubic-yards) to your facility.  Call us for a price!SHAVINGSSecond, we sell SUNCOAST Bedding.  This bedding is not a sawmill by-product (waste product of the lumber industry).  It is produced exclusively as animal bedding with appropriate quality control and standards guaranteed.  Each bag is ultra compressed for more bedding in each bale - the Large Flake bales provide ~10 Cubic Feet of expanded bedding and the Mini-Flake and Quarter Flake each expand to ~8 Cubic Feet. The bedding is screened multiple times to lower the amount of dust which also provides reliable quality of shavings. Since we use the products we sell, we can confidently say that this bedding is very consistent shipment after shipment. Also, their newest product, the Quarter Flake is a small flake (similar to what we used to sell) that sifts through your manure fork very easily. We also like the fact that SUNCOAST Bedding is a ""green company"". Of course, their product is natural and reclaimable. Additionally, any waste created in the manufacturing process is used to fuel their dryer burners...so nothing of the tree is wasted.MANURE REMOVALFor our manure removal customers, we offer two types of service.  First the traditional service where we bring our Trak-Cat (or our tractor with a front end loader) and a dump truck.  We use our Track-Cat to load your manure into the dump truck and remove it.  We've included photos depicting the process and our trucks.    If you have 5-9 horses at your place, we also offer a 16 cubic-yard, roll-off, manure bin (dumpster) service.  You fill the bin up with your manure and bedding waste and once a month (or more often if needed) we'll replace your full bin with a clean and empty one.  This provides you with an environmentally friendly place to store your manure between pick-ups.  There are also photos depicting the delivery truck and bin. If you have a larger facility we can also arrange for a larger bin.  This will reduce the number of ""bin-swaps"" per month and help keep your costs down.MANURE SPREADERWe also have a photo showing our rotary manure spreader dispensing manure onto our pasture.  This revolutionary manure spreader breaks the manure into tiny pieces as you spread, offering an even, easily absorbed distribution of organic fertilizer to your fields.  You can see the 5 foot wide path of evenly spread manure behind the spreader.
