In 1993, he moved from Houston, Texas to Northern Kentucky, and in the same year found the opportunity to pursue his interest in horses. The interest became a lifestyle, and he has been studying and working with horses ever since. He has experience with a wide variety of breeds and disciplines.Bryan received massage training and certification from Equissage, Inc., based in Round Hill VA. He has since continued to expand his knowledge by studying the techniques of other practitioners and instructors of animal massage, and acupressure. He began his practice in 2010, initially concentrating on horses. Many of the clients he worked for would ask if he also worked on dogs. Having the same fondness for dogs as he did for horses, in 2011 he expanded his practice to include canines.In the course of his practice as a massage therapist, Bryan encountered numerous horses with back pain. The massage therapy would help, but the problems would reoccur. Bryan realized that poor saddle fit was the culprit, and set out to obtain the knowledge to offer solutions. In 2013, he completed an extensive 6 month training course that included classroom and hands-on instruction, case studies, volunteer work, internships and research, and became a certified saddle fitter.Debbie LynchHorse SitterDebbie began riding as a teenager. Career and family took her away from horses for a time, but in 1997 she returned to the equestrian world.

What is VOM?Veterinary Orthopedic Manipulation is a healing technology that locates areas of the animal's nervous system that have fallen out of communication.  Healing is induced by re-establishing communication.VOM exists in between veterinary medicine and chiropractic care.  It has similarities to some of the chiropractic modalities, and works to restore function by reducing ""subluxations"" as in chiropractic care.  It uses a hand-held device called a spinal accelerometer.  Why is VOM so accurate?VOM finds and reduces all neuronal subluxations.  All neuronal subluxations in animals have a pathological reflex associated with them.  The reflex is like a ""knee-jerk response.""  It is either there, or not.  It is an objective means to determine the presence and reduction of neuronal subluxations.How it works...All Chiropractic Modalities have one thing in common, they reduce the vertebral subluxation complex  by providing motion or force to the fixated or subluxated joint.",40118,502-938-4894,KY,1000 Dezern Court,"Adrienne Robertson, DVM",Alternative Therapies,adrienne.robertson.dvm@gmail.com

Prior to focusing their attention on racing, Gene and Erin LaCroix enjoyed successful careers in the show horse industry, earning more than 100 U.S. National Championships and two Lifetime Achievement awards. Gene was named the American Horse Shows Association (now U.S. Equestrian Federation) Horsemen of the Year in 1979.The LaCroixes transition to Thoroughbred racing has been the fulfillment of Genes boyhood dream, which began when he accompanied his father, Dr. Eugene E. LaCroix, to the backside of Turf Paradise in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. LaCroix was one of the pioneers of Arabian racing on a pari-mutuel basis, but like his son, his horsemanship was not confined to one specific breed.In 2003, the LaCroixes initiated a rehabilitation and lay-up program for Thoroughbreds under the management of equine care specialist Del Lowell. In 2007, when Gene became a licensed trainer, a training track was added to the farm, further expanding the services the staff was able to offer.Both Gene and Erin are active in all aspects of the operation, from administration and business management to equine care, and because they live on the property, they are responsible for the late barn inspections before turning in themselves. In addition to their public facility, the LaCroixes buy yearlings, train them, and then race and/or market them for their own account, so they are experienced not only as hands-on horsemen, but also know first-hand the special concerns of owners.LaCroix Training Center has earned its reputation as one of Kentuckys premier rehab and lay-up facilities, and is rapidly becoming known for its services in breaking, legging-up, conditioning/galloping and pre-training. Several Grade 1 winners have come to LaCroix, as well as horses owned or trained by some of Americas leading horsemen.LaCroix is a special place, not just because of the facility and services, but because the love of the horses and the horsemanship on which it is founded will always be its priority.",40031,502-222-1795,KY,1000 Bluegrass Parkway,"Del Lowell, Manager",Alternative Therapies,contact@lacroixequine.com

http://www.sporthorsetherapy.com,Lexington,Integrated Sport Horse Therapy - Myofascial Release,"I work with the fascia, or connective tissue of the equine body.  Fascia is known as the organ of form.  It surrounds everything in our structure from organs, blood vessels, and nerves to bones and muscles.    An easy way to see fascia is when preparing a chicken breast.  It's the clear, stretchy material we remove from the meat before cooking it.  So how does this affect your horse?  A horse's fascia can become restricted due to trauma, a slip in the mud, repetitive training routines, poor balance (of the horse and/or rider), scar tissue, and equipment problems such as saddle fit. So instead of being flexible, the fascia thickens and hardens which restricts movement, nerves, blood vessels, etc.  Once an area is restricted, the horse will compensate and move as efficiently as it can; however, it has now created other imbalances perhaps from a limp, so the fascia continues to adapt, change, and become even more restricted.        When the fascia is restricted your horse may exhibit a shortened stride, body soreness, joint stiffness, a sore back, a rotated joint, a hanging knee, lack of speed, or perhaps they are just not moving quite right or to the best of their ability, etc.  The restoration of length and resilience to the fascial tissues will take the pressure off of the nerves and blood vessels reducing pain, as well as restoring alignment to the muscles and mobility to the joints.  The body will experience greater range of motion and movement efficiency.  Structural Integration is not massage therapy or chiropractic work.  This is also not a monthly maintenance program.  I work with your horse typically for 1, 3 or 5 sessions.  The sessions are designed to reintegrate your horses body, and each session builds upon the previous session.",,989-928-9002,,,Heather Brinkman,Alternative Therapies,

http://www.jennifermunson.com,Lexington,Jennifer Munson Photography,"I have been taking pictures for as long as I can remember. My friends and family tell me that they always remembered me having a camera nearby taking photos and freezing time. Although that is true, I didn't become interested in professional photography till after I moved to Kentucky. I grew up horse crazy. My bedroom walls were filled with Breyer horses, my nights at my riding lessons, and my life at home was spent galloping around my living room floor pretending I was a horse. I moved to Kentucky in 2002 and I thought I had died and gone to Heaven. Lexington, Kentucky is a horse girl's paradise. The first year here I went to every horse event that I possibly could with my point and shoot in hand.  I went to my first Breyerfest back in 2004. I was trying to take photos of the various horse acts in the dimly lit indoor arena of the Kentucky Horse Park. Each photo turned out to be a swirl of colors as horse and trainer moved about the arena floor. After the disappointment of of my photos from that event my husband bought me my first DSLR Camera. From that point on my passion for photography grew and grew. After a few years I wanted to turn my passion into a business so I decided to pursue a photography degree at a nearby university. In 2009 I received my Bachelors degree in Fine Art Photography from Eastern Kentucky University.               My story does not end there; it really begins at this point. I was shooting for horse magazines, major events like Breyerfest, and private shoots as well. I was shooting Rolex for USDF when I met a girl who did wedding photography. We spent the summer shooting brides. I really fell in love with weddings. In 2010 I joined up with Frank Becker of The Time Photography. Frank is a Master photographer whom I have been blessed to work with. Here is a link to his stunning work, http://www.thetimephotography.com After spending years photographing weddings I began my own wedding division knows as Jennifer's Weddings.               Every day I fall in love with photography. I am always trying new styles of shooting and new things to shoot, averything to challenge myself and grow.  I have recently began shooting lifestyle images, senior portraits, and pinup. Each unique style of photography builds on the other. Shooting horses has prepared me for the quick pace and action of a wedding. Posing people at a wedding as helped with my portrait/lifestyle images. Understanding studio lighting with my Pinup photography has helped me to control lighting in all other areas of my photography. All of these areas of photography pour directly into my senior portraits.         Jennifer Munson Photography is a husband and wife team that was founded in 2005.

We have drawn from those experiences both good and bad and along with our own concept of customer service we have created what we feel is unrivaled coverage and unparalleled turn around time.When we do an event we have multiple customers that we consider and work for:Show Management can feel at ease knowing we are on the job. Your customers are our customers and we treat each one with the special care and attention that they deserve. Special needs and requests that you have? Not a problem! Just communicate to us what you need and we can make it happen.Exhibitors, when we are covering an event that you are at, you can rest assured that we have your best interest in mind. Not only do we know how to take a great picture, we know when NOT to take a picture. There is so much to keep in mind when photographing horses and the intimate knowledge of the horse and the sport gives us a competitive edge.Horses, even though you can not read this, we do think about you. Without you, none of this would be possible. You are among the most beautiful creatures in the world and we feel privileged to take pictures of such magnificant animals. We are always trying to capture the perfect picture of you and create poetry in motion.Our last customer that we work for is ourselves. We are always striving for that one shot that takes our breath away.

After graduating from Arizona State University, he practiced in Phoenix and upstate New York before moving to Kentucky in 1996. While experienced with a wide variety of architectural building types, Joe was led to a passion for equine design through his wife Pam's longstanding interest in horses. Joe's first equine project was a two-stall barn for the family horse in their upstate New York back yard.Joe enjoys designing barns because of the creative personal collaboration it generates between him, the client, and the particular needs of the project. Horsemen make excellent clients because of their enthusiasm for their horses, whether as their profession or their hobby, and Joe is always eager to help channel that enthusiasm into a successfully designed building that works for both the people and the horses that use it.When not working, Joe enjoys golfing, cooking, and spending time with his family and two dogs. He is also an avid fan of English Premier League football as long as Arsenal is winning. He thinks that every day is a good day when he gets to draw.Prior to establishing his own firm, Joe worked at CMW Architects for 17 years, including serving as a Principal in the firm and Director of Equine Architecture.

http://www.waltersbuildings.com,Lawrenceburg,Walters Buildings,"A tradition of delivering a better building experience is the foundation of Walters Buildings' service to you. Founded by Jack and Alice Walters, our company has been responding to the need for durable, quality buildings since 1958. The first frame building erected was a 40' x 60' machine shed built in Neosho, Wisconsin. Still in use today, it was a progressively new concept, built entirely by hand from digging the holes and setting the trusses to applying the galvanized steel. Progress that has been made since those early days can be seen everywhere. Brilliant color has been added to the galvanized steel, which improved its performance and looks. Round poles gave away to treated square posts which then turned to steel transfer plated columns resulting in engineered buildings for every purpose. Our crews now have specialized construction equipment so buildings can be erected quickly and more efficiently. Jack Walters' sole proprietorship has changed into Jack Walters & Sons, Corp. and now is commonly known as Walters Buildings.At Walters Buildings, our network of locally managed crews is without question the major reason for its success over the years. Working hard year round, they are a tough, skilled group that is specially equipped with heavy-duty equipment that stays with them until the job is done. These well-trained craftsmen understand the need to erect a quality building. They do not take shortcuts just to get the job done. We believe in the concept of having crews that are managed locally. To our customers it means that the personal integrity and capabilities of each crew member is being measured by his friends and neighbors and not by some distant stranger that we'll never see again. In short, they care. We know because their performance proves it.",40342,(800) 225-2590,KY,1429 Hwy 127 Bypass N  /  P.O. Box 258,,"Barn, Stable & Arena Construction",sales@waltersbuildings.com

http://journeyfarmsllc.com/contact/,Smithfield,Journey Farms LLC,"In early 2000, Paul discovered Mary Wanlesss Ride With Your Mind (RWYM) method and found it extraordinarily enlightening.  Here was someone who not only knew what to do but had a clear method of breaking down the what into basic parts and communicating them in an understandable fashion.  Paul became a RWYM enthusiast from that point on.  He immersed himself in her approach and applied it to his own riding.  The positive experiences in Paul's own riding, specifically the clarity it provides riders to affect change, motivated him to leverage this approach with his students.  His experiences as both a student and a teacher prompted him to expand his mastery of the method and pursue certification as a RWYM instructor. Marys RWYM website address is below. Paul has been training with Mary annually since 2007 and working with multiple certified Biomechanics coaches in the US.  He has also been attending annual Biomechanics Teacher Training clinics since 2009. His trainer, Jen Truett, is a RWYM certified coach located in the Dayton area.  Her website is also listed below.Paul has a comprehensive understanding of Marys biomechanics concepts and principles and has a skillful eye for determining the riders biomechanics baseline and areas to address.  Paul effectively communicates the biomechanics methods and skillfully uses verbal instruction, imagery, physical demonstration and alignment to guide the rider through the body biomechanics changes required to greatly improve the riders stability and effectiveness.Paul currently teaches students at his farm, at outside barns, and has conducted training/clinics in the Louisville, Lexington, and Cincinnati, OH area. Paul will be happy to provide references from any of his students if desired.While Paul bases his teaching on Marys RWYM methods, he is not presently a certified RWYM instructor.

http://www.bigasssolutions.com/contact-us/,Lexington,Big Ass Solutions: Big Ass Fans,"Our provocative moniker originated with the massive overhead fans we innovated and perfected to bring comfort and energy savings to large industrial buildings. Today, Big Ass Solutions is much more than industrialand much more than just Big Ass Fans or Big Ass Light. Big Ass means quality, form and function to solve problems in the built environment.So what the heck does that mean? It means having a veritable herd of engineers on staff and the worlds only R&D facility (which is certified LEED Gold, no less) dedicated to testing air movement on a grand scale. It means having an in-house innovation group inventing technology to push the boundaries of what we can do. It means speaking to our customers directly to understand and solve their problems. But mostly it means an insatiable drive to improve, engineer, design, test, re-engineer, re-design and re-test until we get it just right. And then start over again. It means applying our Big Ass approach to other problems, and inventing or reinventing solutions. We dont do things half-ass. We go Big Ass. And thats precisely why theres No Equal.SO, ABOUT THAT NAME Our ceiling fans first hit the market in 1999 with the unremarkable brand name HVLS Fan Co., a nod to the concept of moving high volumes of air at low speeds. After years of hearing customers refer to the industrial models as big-ass fans, we adopted the name and our mascot, Fanny the donkey. When we added our Big Ass Light division, we changed our name again, this time to Big Ass Solutions. Were more than just fans and lightswere in the business of solving your problems.",40511,(877-244-3267),KY,2348 Innovation Drive,,Farm Equipment Sales,

http://lyddanesfarrierservice.yolasite.com/,Lexington,Jody Lyddane,"Horses are unique creatures, every one of them characteristically different than the next. The methods used on one does not necessarily work for the other. Equine professionals, especially Farriers, should recognize and respect that fact. Not only do Farriers have a responsibility to provide the most natural, balanced hoofcare possible but they must be able to assess each horse according to thier individuality and personality.Not every horse requires the application of shoes, many horses are bioligically and genetically capable of going barefoot. A Farrier should be able to make his/her recommendations based on sound advice that applies both common sense, knowledge, and experience. Ultimately, the client/owner knows the horse best and a good Farrier is one who values the horse owner's opinion and takes that information into consideration to make appropriate decisions and recommendations based on the priorities of the horse. ---------Jody is an Army Veteran who continues to serve God and country. He is a family man who has been married to Jennifer for nine years and together they have a six year old girl and a three year old boy. He has been working with, studying, and bonding with horses for over twenty-five years whereas he started training when he was twelve years old. He completed an apprenticeship with Farrier Cheryl Newton of Coxs Creek, Kentucky in 2001 and began his horseshoeing career thereafter. His business was interupted by multiple deployments therefore he no longer practices the art on a full time capacity due to his employment with the Department of Defense; however he now resides in Versailles, Kentucky and is committed to helping horses.

http://kppusa.com,Versailles,Kentucky Performance Products LLC,"HistoryNutrition comes first.Kentucky Performance Products, LLC (KPP) was founded in 1998 by nutritional experts who saw firsthand a need for scientifically based equine supplements targeting specific nutritional problems. It is easy to get carried away when supplementing, says Karen Isberg, KPPs president and founder. Not every horse needs a supplement. A well-balanced diet is essential for good health, and equine supplements should be used in instances where grass, grains and hay dont meet the horses nutritional requirements.From the beginning, the nutritionists and staff at KPP realized the danger of over-supplementation. Kentucky Performance Products, LLC continues to scientifically formulate its products with the horses nutritional needs in mind. Each supplement is targeted and provides only the ingredients necessary to address specific concerns. Ingredients are included at levels that are valuable. Sound research backs the development of each product.Quality assuranceQuality assurance is our promise to you.Quality is a key ingredient found in every bucket of equine supplement offered by Kentucky Performance Products, LLC.

(EHWA)Who We Are and What We Want To DoWe feel the Equine Health and Welfare Alliance, Inc. operates on several levels.Sometimes this is a little difficult to grasp immediately, so we offer the elephant a bite at the time.PRIMARY LEVEL: RESPONSIBILITY IN PERPETUITYFirst, and the most lofty goal of EHWA, is a grass-roots effort to bring change to the way the industry views their responsibility in proper moral and ethical stewardship of the horse. It is the horse that just so happens to be the source or basis for the industrys pleasure and/or economic survival, yet the horse is seldom the direct recipient of any rewards or compensation in any form for its sacrifice.By the industry, we mean any entity (person or business) that touches the horse.The horse is central to the industry. It is unfair to the horse to think of it in the reverse.Although a mammoth undertaking, in so doing, the industry will be challenged to become creative in designing its own business model to accommodate a self-sustaining, perpetual vehicle for the ultimate support of health and welfare for the horse, which includes research.EHWA has ideas as how to accomplish this goal.We see it as an opportunity and an obligation.The sustained, perpetual vehicles of support are not just confined to monies. Products and services can also serve as vehicles of support.It is the creative design and goal of perpetuity that makes this different.That is of smaller, less painful mechanisms that continue over longer periods of time.We have likened it to the windmill, utilizing Natures energy, and the very small well-pipe pumping a trickle of water into a large stock tank day after day. The small trickle of water, for the moment, is inconsequential and may not support one individual.

http://www.equinehealthandwelfare.org,Lexington,Equine Health & Welfare Alliance Inc.,"THE EQUINE HEALTH AND WELFARE ALLIANCE, INC. (EHWA)Who We Are and What We Want To DoWe feel the Equine Health and Welfare Alliance, Inc. operates on several levels.Sometimes this is a little difficult to grasp immediately, so we offer the elephant a bite at the time.PRIMARY LEVEL: RESPONSIBILITY IN PERPETUITYFirst, and the most lofty goal of EHWA, is a grass-roots effort to bring change to the way the industry views their responsibility in proper moral and ethical stewardship of the horse. It is the horse that just so happens to be the source or basis for the industrys pleasure and/or economic survival, yet the horse is seldom the direct recipient of any rewards or compensation in any form for its sacrifice.By the industry, we mean any entity (person or business) that touches the horse.The horse is central to the industry. It is unfair to the horse to think of it in the reverse.Although a mammoth undertaking, in so doing, the industry will be challenged to become creative in designing its own business model to accommodate a self-sustaining, perpetual vehicle for the ultimate support of health and welfare for the horse, which includes research.EHWA has ideas as how to accomplish this goal.We see it as an opportunity and an obligation.The sustained, perpetual vehicles of support are not just confined to monies. Products and services can also serve as vehicles of support.It is the creative design and goal of perpetuity that makes this different.That is of smaller, less painful mechanisms that continue over longer periods of time.We have likened it to the windmill, utilizing Natures energy, and the very small well-pipe pumping a trickle of water into a large stock tank day after day. The small trickle of water, for the moment, is inconsequential and may not support one individual. But over time, as the small stream never ceases filling, and often overflowing, the large reservoir of the tank, life will be sustained for the whole herd.",40583,,KY,P.O.

The committee saw many additional horse owners' needs they wanted to address. So, on May 3, 2006 a group of equine leaders from Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties and representatives from the three Extension Services and Conservation Districts met to discuss equine industry needs. The Northern Kentucky Horse Network grew from that meeting. A half-dozen horse owners met regularly to create mission and vision statements, draft bylaws and brainstorm the needs and projects for the region's horses and horse owners. The Network met with representatives from the Kentucky Horse Council and the Kentucky Equine Education Project and obtained a start-up grant from KEEP.

(EHWA)Who We Are and What We Want To DoWe feel the Equine Health and Welfare Alliance, Inc. operates on several levels.Sometimes this is a little difficult to grasp immediately, so we offer the elephant a bite at the time.PRIMARY LEVEL: RESPONSIBILITY IN PERPETUITYFirst, and the most lofty goal of EHWA, is a grass-roots effort to bring change to the way the industry views their responsibility in proper moral and ethical stewardship of the horse. It is the horse that just so happens to be the source or basis for the industrys pleasure and/or economic survival, yet the horse is seldom the direct recipient of any rewards or compensation in any form for its sacrifice.By the industry, we mean any entity (person or business) that touches the horse.The horse is central to the industry. It is unfair to the horse to think of it in the reverse.Although a mammoth undertaking, in so doing, the industry will be challenged to become creative in designing its own business model to accommodate a self-sustaining, perpetual vehicle for the ultimate support of health and welfare for the horse, which includes research.EHWA has ideas as how to accomplish this goal.We see it as an opportunity and an obligation.The sustained, perpetual vehicles of support are not just confined to monies. Products and services can also serve as vehicles of support.It is the creative design and goal of perpetuity that makes this different.That is of smaller, less painful mechanisms that continue over longer periods of time.We have likened it to the windmill, utilizing Natures energy, and the very small well-pipe pumping a trickle of water into a large stock tank day after day. The small trickle of water, for the moment, is inconsequential and may not support one individual. But over time, as the small stream never ceases filling, and often overflowing, the large reservoir of the tank, life will be sustained for the whole herd.",40583,,KY,P.O.

http://www.thoroughbred-center.com,Lexington,The Thoroughbred Center,"The Thoroughbred Center is located in Fayette County, Kentucky, just outside the city limits of Lexington. Built in 1969, and formally named the Kentucky Horse Center was originally situated on 133 acres of prime central Kentucky farmland. Established as a Thoroughbred training and sales facility by Rex Elsworth and Dr. Arnold Pessin, KHC was immediately popular as an alternative to training at the local racetracks. Amenities at the training facility included a 5/8-mile track with a metal roof, two barns made primarily of concrete with metal roofs that could house up to 260 horses and had 40 tack rooms and a state of the art, 920 seat sales pavilion, complete with a lounge and full service bar. Thoroughbred sales were slower to catch on, with the first in 1972 when Fasig Tipton used the facility for their inaugural Thoroughbred auction. Elsworths financial difficulties in the mid-seventies forced the sale of KHC. Joseph Johnson III purchased KHC at a commissioners sale to add to his considerable land holdings in the immediate area. Johnson at one time owned nearly 5000 acres in Fayette County and among his holdings was the Log Cabin Farm, which bordered KHC to the east. After Johnson purchased the training and sales facility the barns currently numbered 3 through 8 were relocated to KHC from Miles Park, a defunct racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky. By 1974 Johnson had constructed an additional six barns, which make up barns 18 through 23. In addition, Johnson had begun construction of a larger training track, which would eventually become what is now a one-mile, all weather training track. The original one-mile track was surfaced with a bark footing that had become popular in Europe. This surface proved to be incompatible with the extremes of Kentucky weather and would eventually be replaced with a sand, silt, clay surface typical of most Thoroughbred racetracks.In 1984, Spendthrift Farm had become the leader among Thoroughbred farms in Kentucky and was rapidly expanding its holdings in the Lexington area. With the two most recent Triple Crown winners standing at stud and their yearling division a perennial leader at the July selected sales, Spendthrift diversified by purchasing the Kentucky Horse Center. During its three-year ownership, Spendthrift constructed additional nine barns on the original 133 acres and purchased, from Johnson, the135 acre Log Cabin Farm with its three barns, managers house and heliport. Spendthrift renovated an existing 12-stall barn and added 44 stalls by enclosing the outer perimeter of the barn, making what is currently barn 30. Spendthrift completed a $1,000,000 renovation to the main building, which included hard wood floors and paneling of the North upstairs wing of the offices.A failed public offering of stock in Spendthrift started a financial slide from which the farm would never recover. Johnson had carried a mortgage on the property and retook possession in 1987. Johnson again operated KHC until June of 1989 when Tinkham Veale of Cleveland, Ohio, along with an assortment of partners purchased controlling interest in KHC. Major renovations of the backside were initiated after the purchase with the intention of selling the barn areas to the trainers/owners in a condo association fashion. When the condo association plan failed Veale bought out the partners, taking the company private once again.As alternative sources of revenue, KHC developed uses for the existing facilities and equipment, including a tour division, an entertainment division, a childrens theatre program and a division that provides farm care and construction services for area farms and residents.In 1998 The Kentucky Horse Center was purchased by Churchill Downs out of Louisville and were owners of the facility until April of 2000 when Keeneland, Lexingtons local racecourse purchased the facility. In the transition, the KHC name was changed to The Thoroughbred Center and an expansion was made to the facility with an additional five barns added to enable the facility to house up to 1,180 horses. The facility normally operates with an occupancy of 900-1000 horses and is open year round. Keeneland continues to invest substantial capital into the facility, with the intention of making TTC the most popular Thoroughbred training facility in the country.",40511,859-293-1853,KY,3380 Paris Pike,,Race Horse Breeding & Sales,Info@TheThoroughbredCenter.com

http://www.claibornefarm.com,Paris,Claiborne Farm,"The world-renowned Kentucky Thoroughbred farm, Claiborne, has origins in Virginia. There Civil War veteran Capt. Richard Hancock raised Thoroughbreds on the Ellerslie Farm of his wife's family. The move to Kentucky came with the next generation when Capt. Hancock's son Arthur B. Hancock established a second farm on the property of his own bride and named it Claiborne. The Kentucky farm gradually eclipsed the Virginia property, and Arthur Hancock launched an operation which strongly influenced the path of American breeding in the first half of the 20th Century. Importations of such European horses as Sir Gallahad III and Blenheim II resulted in the likes of Triple Crown winners Gallant Fox and Whirlaway, while Hancock's advice in the bloodstock enterprises of many of America's industrial giants added to his influence. Indeed, on his death in 1957, the English annual Bloodstock Breeders' Review described him as ""probably the most influential breeder in the history of the American Turf."" His son then stepped up to match that status in his own era.Arthur B. (Bull) Hancock Jr. continued the pattern of breeding major winners, importing important stallions, and dealing with the elite among American breeders. His imported Nasrullah led the sire list five times and begot Bold Ruler, which led it no fewer than eight times and sired the immortal Secretariat. Hancock also bred and stood Round Table, syndicated Nijinsky II, and managed the stallion career of Buckpasser. These and other epic names liberally covered the canvas that was the portrait of Claiborne Farm during his lifetime.In 1972, Seth Hancock, stepped up to make his own headlines when he syndicated Secretariat for a record $6 million. This was merely the launch of an era of Seth's leadership of Claiborne, which mirrors that of his ancestors and continues over four decades later. Again, the underpinning of Claiborne was the management of its own and clients' high quality broodmare bands, while the headlines were provided by the stallions and race horses. Seth has matched the parade of stallions acquired and managed by his father and grandfather, as such names as Mr. Prospector, Danzig, and Seeking the Gold took their places in history. Modern stallions have increased to 27 the number of times the leading sire of the year has stood at Claiborne Farm. Meanwhile, Seth won a Kentucky Derby with Swale, campaigned two-time Breeders' Cup winner Lure, bred and raced champion Forty Niner, and authored a lasting influence on the international Turf as the breeder of stallions Nureyev and Caerleon and the dam of Sadler's Wells.The strand of Claiborne Farm's influence has been strong and unbroken, and now leads into its second century.",40362,859-987-2330,KY,703 Winchester Rd  /  P.O.

,Paris,Adena Springs,"The original Adena Springs farm in Kentucky, consisting of 640 acres located on Route 60 just outside of Versailles, was purchased in August of 1989. The oldest known inhabitants of the land were the Adena Indians, who had been attracted to the area by quality of the water in the free-flowing local springs. The farm was named after the Adenas, both as a tribute and as a commitment to perpetuate in this land the grace, spirit and strength they instilled there.In 2005 we purchased more than 2,000 acres in Bourbon County, KY, and designed a magnificent, state-of-the-art facility for this fresh land. In August 2007, we moved our entire Kentucky operation, including the all of our stallions, to Paris, KY, beginning a new chapter in our Central Kentucky history.Adena Springs South began operation in October of 1996 with the purchase of the 453-acre Lin-Drake Farm, located just north of Ocala in Williston, Florida. In November of 1997, an additional 553 acres were purchased on nearby State Highway 318. The following June, the purchase of two adjacent tracts of land brought the total amount of acreage in Florida to 1100. Four exciting young stallions will stand the 2015 season at Adena South - 2012 Breeders' Cup Classic champion Fort Larned, Hunters Bay, a champion son of Ghostzapper, City Wolf, a graded stakes-winning brother to Ghostzapper and City Zip and Capo Bastone, winner of the sire-making King's Bishop Stakes (G1).The expansion to the farms current state was completed in July of 1999, when an additional 1050 acres were purchased directly across Highway 318. This has allowed us to centralize our entire regional operation in one location, as Adena Springs South now encompasses some 3800 acres of some of the best land on which to raise horses in Florida. It is here that our young racing prospects receive their early lessons on our one-mile main track. The training center also features eight spacious 36-stall barns, constructed with the safety and welfare of our horses and staff as number one priorities.When Adena Springs began operation, it was with the thought that it would be a private nursery, designed to provide horses for the Stronach Stable racing operation. These goals changed dramatically, almost from the beginning, and the focus of the farm is now epitomized by our approach to sales and stallions.From the start, the Stronach family has been firmly committed to offering the best stallion roster anywhere, and we are extremely proud of our success.",40361,859-987-1798 / 859-351-3987,KY,701 Cane Ridge Road,General Manager:  Eoin Ryan,Race Horse Breeding & Sales,eryan@adenastallions.com
http://www.lanesend.com,Versailles,Lane's End,"The Lanes End name is synonymous with quality, and in racing, theres no better way to judge quality than by stakes winners. In 2014, Lanes End stallions have dominated their North American peers by this measure.As of June 3, Lanes End stallions have sired 43 stakes winners, which easily puts Lanes End as the #1 farm by stakes winners. The second-ranked farm has 35 stakes winners (with five more stallions); the third-ranked 26.Looked at another way, Lanes End has a remarkable SIX sires with five or more stakes winners on the year. They are led by CITY ZIP (9), CANDY RIDE (ARG) (7), SMART STRIKE (7), ENGLISH CHANNEL (6), LEMON DROP KID (6), and CURLIN (5).How good are Lanes End sires? Only one other Kentucky nursery has two stallions who have sired 6 SWs on the year, and no farm stands three or more sires who can claim the feat. No farm, except for Lanes End, which has five stallions with 6 or more SWs. Thats an incredible concentration of sire prowess under the Lanes End banner.One of the reasons for the success of Lanes End sires the direct support of our broodmare band. In 2013, standouts like Palace Malice (CURLIN), Revolutionary (WAR PASS), Top Billing (CURLIN) and Class Leader (SMART STRIKE) were bred by Lanes End.

Help us keep our trails clean.Trail 1: This 5.2 mile trail departs from the C area. Riders follow the trail along the western edge of Fords Bay on Lake Barkley. This trail offers many scenic vistas and opportunities to view wildlife such as bald eagles, ospreys, waterfowl, and shorebirds. Binoculars recommended.Trail 2: This short two-mile loop trail provides a beautiful late afternoon or early morning ride. It departs from the C trail head.

We designed Trail 4 to follow saddles and ridge tops which minimize erosion and resource damage. Horse enthusiasts enjoy this trail at night riding under a full moon.Tobacco Barn | FS Rd #172Tobacco was a staple crop in the region. Evidence of its importance can be seen at this abandoned farm and homestead in the southern end of Wranglers off Forest Service Road 172. This old tobacco barn has been standing for decades. Its solid construction barely shows the passage of time. Other structures nearby  an old chicken coop, shed, and the homestead  itself  wear their age with grace and dignity.Trail 5: This 9.3 mile trail departs from the A trail head by the old Tobacco Barn. On this trail you will find many natural springs, gentle rolling hills, and fields.Home is where the Habitat isTake notice of small ponds. These small wetland ecosystems provide habitat for waterfowl nests, aquatic reptiles, and amphibians. Ponds provide food, water, and shelter for many species of wildlife you may never see.Riding in creeks and streams pollutes our watersheds. Avoid lengthy rides in creeks, streams, ponds, and lakes. Protect our wildlife.Trail 6: Departing from the day-use area, this 11.8 mile trail takes you to Blue Hole. Pack a lunch for a relaxing picnic by the creek  we provide picnic tables and tethering poles. You might want to also visit the block building, Laura Furnace, plus the historical marker and grave of The Little Drummer Boy. Blue HoleLaura Furnace Creek empties into Blue Hole, a deep spring rich in blue color for most of the year. Located on the south end of our horseback riding area, its a favorite spot for riders because of the peaceful scenery, cool water and proximity to many historic sites.Notice the abundance of shiny blue rocks on the ground? Thats slag, evidence of the Laura Iron Furnace. It ceased operations more than 100 years ago and left a permanent mark on the landscape. This historic site offers a conservation learning opportunity.Remember, leave the slag or blue rocks behind for others to enjoy. These date from the late 1800s Iron Industry and are a protected part of history. To learn more, visit the Center or Great Western Iron Furnaces display boards.Laura FurnaceIron ore production helped the area prosper during the mid-1800s. It also took its toll on the environment. On the eastern boundary of Wranglers, Laura Furnace Creek flows right by the site of the old Laura Furnace. Notice the blue slag covering the forest floor, a by-product of the smelting process. Up the hill, large stones are testament to the furnace structure, now long gone. Observe the uniform size of the meadows trees; all planted at the same time. Workers cut timber near iron furnaces for charcoal, the iron furnaces fuel supply. The Laura Furnace ceased production in 1880, and the forest is still recovering from its overuse.Little Drummer BoyHistorians believe Nathan Futrell to be the youngest drummer boy in the Revolutionary War at seven years old. The childhood adventures of this little American patriot have become the stuff of legend. By 1820, the North Carolina-born Futrell had settled right here on Fords Creek where he planted the areas first apple orchard. He and his wife, Charity, are buried up a hill a mile or two beyond Wranglers Campground. The Daughters of the American Revolution erected a plaque in honor of Futrells war contributions.

Gene was named the American Horse Shows Association (now U.S. Equestrian Federation) Horsemen of the Year in 1979.The LaCroixes transition to Thoroughbred racing has been the fulfillment of Genes boyhood dream, which began when he accompanied his father, Dr. Eugene E. LaCroix, to the backside of Turf Paradise in Phoenix, Arizona. Dr. LaCroix was one of the pioneers of Arabian racing on a pari-mutuel basis, but like his son, his horsemanship was not confined to one specific breed.In 2003, the LaCroixes initiated a rehabilitation and lay-up program for Thoroughbreds under the management of equine care specialist Del Lowell. In 2007, when Gene became a licensed trainer, a training track was added to the farm, further expanding the services the staff was able to offer.Both Gene and Erin are active in all aspects of the operation, from administration and business management to equine care, and because they live on the property, they are responsible for the late barn inspections before turning in themselves. In addition to their public facility, the LaCroixes buy yearlings, train them, and then race and/or market them for their own account, so they are experienced not only as hands-on horsemen, but also know first-hand the special concerns of owners.LaCroix Training Center has earned its reputation as one of Kentuckys premier rehab and lay-up facilities, and is rapidly becoming known for its services in breaking, legging-up, conditioning/galloping and pre-training. Several Grade 1 winners have come to LaCroix, as well as horses owned or trained by some of Americas leading horsemen.LaCroix is a special place, not just because of the facility and services, but because the love of the horses and the horsemanship on which it is founded will always be its priority.",40031,502-222-1795,KY,1000 Bluegrass Parkway,"Del Lowell, Manager",Training,contact@lacroixequine.com
